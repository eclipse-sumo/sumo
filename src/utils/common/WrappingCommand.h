/**
 * @class WrappingCommand
 * @brief A wrapper for a Command function
 *
 * In order to ease life, this class may encapsulate a method of a class which
 *  in order to be used as a Command. This allows to use a member methods
 *  of a class to be called as Commands are, avoiding that the instance itself
 *  is destroyed by the EventHandler.
 *
 * Because in some cases, the Command may live longer than the instance class,
 *  a boolean value indicates that the Command is "descheduled". It should
 *  be set via "deschedule" as soon as the class instance of which a method
 *  is encapsulated is destroyed and forces that the command (calling of this
 *  instace's method) is not executed.
 *
 * @see Design Patterns, Gamma et al.
 * @see Command
 * @see MSEventControl
