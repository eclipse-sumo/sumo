 * @class Command
 * @brief Base (microsim) event class
 *
 * Classes derived from Command may be added to MSEventControl instances in
 *  order to be executed at a certain time step.
 *
 * As soon as the simulation reaches the desired time step, the command (event)
 *  is executed by calling "execute" with the current time step. The method must
 *  return either 0, if the event shall not be executed again or a positive value
 *  (in simulation seconds) that described when it shall be executed again. The method
 *  must not return a value below zero, the behaviour is undefined in this case.
 *
 * @warning The EventControl the Command is added to gets responsible for
 *  this command's deletion.
 *
 * @see Design Patterns, Gamma et al.
 * @see WrappingCommand
