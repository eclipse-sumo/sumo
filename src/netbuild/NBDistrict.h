/**
 * @class NBDistrict
 * @brief A class representing a single district
 *
 * A "district" is an area within the network which may be referenced by
 *  O/D-matrices. It stems from importing VISUM-networks. Work with VISUM-
 *  -networks also made it necessary that a district knows the edges at
 *  which new vehicles shall approach the simulated network (sources) and
 *  those to use when leaving the network (sinks). These connections to the
 *  network are weighted.
 *
 * Later work on VISUM required also parsing the shape of a district. This
 *  information is used by some external tools only, it is even not shown
 *  within the GUI.
 *
 * @todo Recheck whether this can be somehow joined with ODDistrict
