 * @class MSE2Collector
 * @brief An areal detector corresponding to a sequence of consecutive lanes
 *
 * This detector traces vehicles which are on a sequence of consecutive lanes. A
 *  vehicle that enters the detector is stored and the stored vehicles' speeds
 *  are used within each timestep to compute the detector values. As soon as the
 *  vehicle leaves the detector, it is no longer tracked.
 *
 * Determining entering and leaving vehicles is done via the MSMoveReminder
 *  interface. The values are computed by an event-callback (at the end of
 *  a time step).
 *
 * @note As soon as a vehicle enters the detector, a VehicleInfo object is created
 *        and stored in myVehicleInfos. This is constantly updated as long as the
 *        vehicle stays on the detector (i.e. calls notifyMove()). All movement
 *        notifications sent by vehicles on the detector are temporarily stored
 *        in myMoveNotifications, see notifyMove(). Finally they are integrated
 *        into myVehicleInfos when updateDetector is called.
 * @note When subclassing this detector, it is probably sufficient to adapt the
 *        definition of the structs VehicleInfo and the MoveNotification, as well as
 *        the methods that define and create those structs, i.e., makeVehicleInfo()
 *        and makeMoveNotification(). Further the integration of new movement
 *        notifications of the last time step into the vehicle infos is done
 *        in updateVehicleInfos().
 *
