/** @class MSCFModel_CC
 * @brief A set of automatic Cruise Controllers, including classic Cruise
 * Control (CC), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise
 * Control (CACC). Take as references the chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the Rajamani's
 * book "Vehicle dynamics and control" (2011).
 * This model is meant to be used for simulation of platooning systems in mixed
 * scenarios, so with automatic and driver controlled vehicles.
 * The platooning manager is a distributed application implemented for veins
 * (so for omnet++) supported by a 802.11p based communication protocol, which
 * will determine the actions to be performed (such as switching on the
 * automatic controller, or the lane to move to) and communicate them to this
 * car following models via TraCI
 * @see MSCFModel
