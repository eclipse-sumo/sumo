 * @class MSTransportableDevice_Routing
 * @brief A device that performs person rerouting based on current edge speeds

 *  and simulation-wide static methods for collecting edge weights and
 *  parallelizing in MSRoutingEngine.
 *
 * A device is assigned using the common explicit/probability - procedure.
 *
 * A device computes a new route for a person as soon as a personTrip appears in the plan.
