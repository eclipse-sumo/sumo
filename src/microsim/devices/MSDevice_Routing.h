/**
 * @class MSDevice_Routing
 * @brief A device that performs vehicle rerouting based on current edge speeds
 *
 * The routing-device system consists of in-vehicle devices that perform the routing
 *  and simulation-wide static methods for collecting edge weights and
 *  parallelizing in MSRoutingEngine.
 *
 * A device is assigned to a vehicle using the common explicit/probability - procedure.
 *
 * A device computes a new route for a vehicle as soon as the vehicle is inserted
 *  (within "enterLaneAtInsertion") - and, if the given period is larger than 0 - each
 *  x time steps where x is the period. This is triggered by an event that executes
 *  "wrappedRerouteCommandExecute".
