 * @class ODMatrix
 * @brief An O/D (origin/destination) matrix
 *
 * This class is the internal representation of a loaded O/D-matrix. Beside
 *  being the storage for ODCells, the matrix also contains information about
 *  the numbers of loaded, discarded, and written vehicles.
 *
 * The matrix has a reference to the container of districts stored. This allows
 *  to validate added cell descriptions in means that using existing origins/
 *  destinations only is assured.
 *
 * In addition of being a storage, the matrix is also responsible for writing
 *  the results and contains methods for splitting the entries over time.
