abstract={The development of surrogate safety measures has drawn significant research interest in the field of traffic safety analysis. Innovative data sources such as video-based traffic surveillance systems have made it possible to collect large amounts of microscopic traffic data. By deriving traffic safety indicators such as the Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Crash (DRAC) statements concerning traffic safety over a determined road section can be made. This work presents the derivation of a novel surrogate safety indicator based on a Constant Initial Acceleration and reaction time assumption which considers the interaction between vehicles and describes the traffic safety of a road section. The evaluation is based on a video-based microscopic traffic data collection. To examine the efficiency, the new developed indicator is compared to the original Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Crash (DRAC) and the modified indicator (MDRAC) which includes the reaction time. The results showed that the new indicator is more sensitive in detecting critical situations than the other indicators and in addition describes the conflict situations more realistically.},

However, the driver’s Perception-Reaction Time (PRT), an important variable in crash mechanism, has not been considered widely into surrogate measures. In this regard, it is important to know how the PRT affects the performances of surrogate indicators. To this end, three widely used surrogate measures are firstly modified by involving the PRT into their crash mechanisms. Then, in order to examine the difference caused by the PRT, a comparative study is carried out on a freeway section of the Pacific Motorway, Australia. This result suggests that the surrogate indicators’ performances in representing rear-end crash risks are improved with the incorporating of the PRT for the investigated section.},

  abstract     = {{The dynamics of a line of traffic composed of n vehicles is studied mathematically. It is postulated that the movements of the several vehicles are controlled by an idealized ``law of separation.'' The law considered in the analysis specifies that each vehicle must maintain a certain prescribed ``following distance'' from the preceding vehicle. This distance is the sum of a distance proportional to the velocity of the following vehicle and a certain given minimum distance of separation when the vehicles are at rest. By the application of this postulated law to the motion of the column of vehicles, the differential equations governing the dynamic state of the system are obtained.The solution of the dynamical equations for several assumed types of motion of the leading vehicle is effected by the operational or Laplace transform method and the velocities and accelerations of the various vehicles are thus obtained. Consideration is given to the use of an electrical analog computer for studying the dynamical equations of the system.}},
