SUMO edge type file for importing OpenStreetMap files. It contains the
edge type configuration for roads inside of towns and located in
Germany. If you want to import such an OpenStreetMap file, you can use
this file as is. In some rare cases, you might want to consider modified
values for some edge types though. See [SUMO edge type
file](SUMO_edge_type_file.md) for an explanation of the file's
content.
