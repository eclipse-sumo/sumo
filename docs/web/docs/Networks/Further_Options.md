title: Further Options
---

[netconvert](../netconvert.md),
[netgenerate](../netgenerate.md), and [netedit](../Netedit/index.md)
offer some more options to describe how the network shall be imported.
The scope of some options does not cover all import types.

## Setting default Values

It was mentioned, that edge parameter may be omitted and defaults will
be used in this case. It is possible to set default values for the
imported edges' number of lanes, allowed speed, and priority, using the
options **--default.lanenumber** {{DT_INT}} (or **-L** {{DT_INT}} for short), **--default.speed** {{DT_FLOAT}} (or **-S** {{DT_FLOAT}} for short), **--default.priority** {{DT_INT}} (or **-P** {{DT_INT}} for short),
respectively.

## Adding Turnarounds

Normally, turnarounds are added as a possible edge continuations and
play an important role during network building (see
[Publications\#Krajzewicz_et_al2005_2](../Publications.md#publications_using_sumo)).
Still, one may want not to add them. In this cases, it is possible to
disallow their appending using option **--no-turnarounds**.

## Removing Geometry Nodes

In most input networks one may find nodes where one street comes in and
one with the same attributes goes out or where two parallel edges come
in and two (with the same attributes) come out. Such nodes have mostly
no meaning (maybe besides the additional possibility to make a U-turn)
and may be removed. The removal of such nodes increases the simulation
speed due to a smaller number of edges to process during each time step.
To remove such nodes and join the incoming and outgoing edges use **--geometry.remove**. The
removal of nodes preserves the geometry of edges by adding a further
geometry point at the removed node's position.

## Using Edges' maximum Speed Definitions in km/h

Some people do not like to use speed definitions in m/s. If you want to
define the speeds allowed on your edges in km/h instead, you should pass
the option **--speed-in-kmh** to [netconvert](../netconvert.md).

## Importing Networks without Traffic Light Logic

Some of the supported network formats supply information about the logic
of the traffic lights, other do not. Due to this, we have to compute the
traffic lights on our own. Doing this, we not only have to compute the
signal plans but also compute which junctions will have traffic lights.
There are several options steering this procedure. At first, you have to
tell
[netconvert](../netconvert.md)/[netgenerate](../netgenerate.md)
that you wish the program to guess positions of traffic lights. This is
done using the **--tls.guess**-option.

You may also set junctions as tls-controlled using **--tls.set** or as uncontrolled
using **--tls.unset**. Both options assume to get a list of node names divided by ','
as parameter. The behavior when a node is in both lists is undefined.

During the computation of tls-logics among other information we have to
guess the duration of the phases. The options **--tls.green.time** and **--tls.yellow.time** allow you to give
the durations of green and yellow lights. Both options assume the
duration in seconds as an int. The duration of having red is dependent
on the number of other phases and their green and yellow phase
durations. The green phase length has a default of 31s, yellow lights
are - if no value is set for this option - computed using the **--tls.yellow.min-decel** which is
described below.

There is yet no possibility to compute or estimate a "green wave"
(synchronized traffic lights to allow continuous flow in one direction).
You have only the options to shift the computed phases by half of their
duration or by a quarter of their duration. The options for this are: **--tls.half-offset**
and **--tls.quarter-offset**. Both options assume to get a list of node names divided by ',' as
parameter. The behavior when a node is in both lists or if the node is
not meant to be controlled by a tls is undefined. Of course you can also
edit the offsets within the generated network file (see
[Simulation/Traffic Lights](../Simulation/Traffic_Lights.md)).

## Guessing On- and Off-Ramps

Most of the imported network descriptions do not have information about
highway on- and off-ramps. This means ramps are connected to the highway
without acceleration/deceleration lanes. You can force
[netconvert](../netconvert.md) to guess where on- and off-ramps
shall be build. To enable this, use the option **--ramps.guess**. The algorithm ensures
that acceleration lanes are added on highway junctions with one incoming
and one outgoing highway edge and one incoming minor edge and that
deceleration lanes are added on highway junctions with one incoming and
one outgoing highway edge and one outgoing minor edge. Lanes are only
added if the sum of incoming lanes differs from the sum of outgoing
lanes. You can constrain the classification of highways by setting a
minimum speed of this edge using **--ramps.min-highway-speed** {{DT_FLOAT}} and the classification of the minor
edge is by setting its maximum speed using **--ramps.max-ramp-speed** {{DT_FLOAT}} (both options assume a speed
in m/s). Furthermore, **--ramps.ramp-length** tells [netconvert](../netconvert.md) how
long the added ramp shall be in meters.

!!! note
    Normally, we keep **--ramps.ramp-length** unset and let the geometry computation do the rest.

## Inner-junction Traffic

If you already know SUMO or if you have taken a look at some of the
examples you may have noticed that vehicles used to "jump" over a
junction instead of driving over them. This behavior was quite
appropriate for simulating large scenarios as in these cases the
simulation error could be neglected (at least we have neglected it).
Since version 0.10.0 SUMO will by default simulate traffic over the
junctions in a way you know it from reality. Because inserting inner
lanes into a network dramatically increases the network's size, you may
want to return to the old behavior using the option **--no-internal-links**.

## Pruning the imported network

[netconvert](../netconvert.md) offers you some possibilities to
constrain the read edges what is quite needful if one has a large street
network but only wants to simulate a part of it or only the major roads.
The first possibility to constrain the input is to name all the edges
you want to keep. You can either do this on the command line/within your
configuration directly using **--keep-edges.explicit** {{DT_IDList}}[,{{DT_IDList}}\]\* where each {{DT_IDList}} represents the id of an edge
you want to keep separated by a ',' or you can save this list into a
file where each id is stored in a separate line and then let
[netconvert](../netconvert.md) read this file using **--keep-edges.input-file** {{DT_FILE}}. In the case
you are joining edges using **--geometry.remove** (see "Removing Geometry Nodes"), you may
also be interested in the option **--keep-edges.postload** which forces
[netconvert](../netconvert.md) to join the edges first and remove
the unwished afterwards.

It is also possible to constrain the imported edges by giving a minimum
velocity that is allowed on an edge in order to include this edge into
the generated network. Use **--keep-edges.min-speed** {{DT_FLOAT}} for this where {{DT_FLOAT}} is the minimum velocity an
edge must allow in order to be included in the output in m/s.
