| SUMO edge type file |                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Filename extension | .typ.xml              |
| Type of content    | Road type description |
| Open format?       | Yes                   |
| SUMO specific?     | Yes                   |
| XML Schema         | [types_file.xsd](https://sumo.dlr.de/xsd/types_file.xsd)        |

A **SUMO edge type file** assigns default values for certain attributes
to types of roads. It configures [netconvert](netconvert.md)
when importing, for example, [SUMO XML
descriptions](Networks/PlainXML.md),
[OpenStreetMap files](OpenStreetMap_file.md) or [ArcView
files](Networks/Import/ArcView.md). The type configuration is
saved in an XML structure. It is always possible to load multiple type
maps and redefining types partly or completely when loading an
additional file.

This article introduces the file format first. After that, it discusses
the application of the SUMO edge type file on certain types of map files
and collects reasonable templates for these map files. *You are very
welcome to provide additional templates for various contexts or to start
a discussion about existing templates.*

## Syntax

The XML root element is called *types*. It contains a collection of
*type* elements. A type element represents a record with the following
attributes:

| Attribute Name | Value Type  | Description                            |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **id**         | id (string) | The name of the road type. This is the only mandatory attribute. For OpenStreetMap data, the name could, for example, be *highway.trunk* or *highway.residential*. For ArcView data, the name of the road type is a number. |
| allow          | string      | List of allowed vehicle classes. The classes are space separated (e.g. "pedestrian bicycle").                                                                                                                               |
| disallow       | string      | List of not allowed vehicle classes. The classes are space separated too.                                                                                                                                                   |
| discard        | bool        | If set to true, edges of that type are not imported. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.                                                                                                                            |
| numLanes       | int         | The number of lanes on an edge. This is the default number of lanes per direction.                                                                                                                                          |
| oneway         | bool        | If set to true, only the edge for one direction is created during the import (defaults to true). (This attribute makes no sense for SUMO XML descriptions but, for example, for OpenStreetMap files.)                                                |
| priority       | int         | A number, which determines the priority between different road types. netconvert derives the right-of-way rules at junctions from the priority. The number starts with one; higher numbers represent more important roads.  |
| speed          | float       | The default (implicit) speed limit in m/s.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| sidewalkWidth  | float       | The default width for added sidewalks (defaults to -1 which disables extra sidewalks).                                                                                                                                      |

The names of the SUMO vehicle classes are:

- **By ownership**

  private, public_transport, public_emergency, public_authority, public_army, vip, ignoring,

- **By size**

  passenger (a “normal” car), hov, taxi, bus, delivery, transport, lightrail, cityrail, rail_slow, rail_fast, motorcycle, bicycle, pedestrian.

So an example of a SUMO edge type file is:

```xml
<types>
    <type id="highway.motorway" priority="13" numLanes="2" speed="44.0" />
    <type id="highway.residential" priority="4" numLanes="1" speed="13.889" />
</types>
```

## Templates for OpenStreetMap

The SUMO edge type file defines default values for some tags, which are
taken if no explicit value is given for a certain road in a
OpenStreetMap file. So the OpenStreetMap tags *maxspeed*, *lanes* and
*oneway* override these defaults. If the map is tagged correctly, these
tags should only be omitted if their value equals an implicitly assumed
value. In this section, SUMO edge type files are collected that contain
these implicit values of OpenStreetMap for various contexts. The
following OpenStreetMap pages help to find out the implicit values for
the following attributes:

- **allow/disallow**

  [Map features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features), [OSM tags for routing/Access restrictions](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_tags_for_routing/Access-Restrictions).

- **numLanes**

  [Map features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features), [Editing standards and
  conventions](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editing_Standards_and_Conventions),
  [Key:lanes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:lanes),
  [Key:highway](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) and
  [Tagging scheme by
  country](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tagging).

- **priority**

  [Map features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features).

- **oneway**

  [Key:oneway](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:oneway).

- **speed**

  [Key:maxspeed](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:maxspeed),
  [OSM tags for
  routing/Maxspeed](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_tags_for_routing#Max_speed),
  [Key:source:maxspeed](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:source:maxspeed)
  and
  [Key:traffic_sign](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:traffic_sign).
  Wikipedia lists the [Speed limits by
  country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limits_by_country).

The right values are hard to find, because they depend at least partly
on the legislation (maxspeed, for example); the values vary from country
to country. Further context information, like the fact whether a road is
inside or outside a city border, may determine the defaults as well. In
the following, SUMO edge type files for various contexts are given,
using the country as the main ordering criterion. The lists and files
contain only way types as they correspond to SUMO edges; node and area
types (like highway=services) are not considered. *You are very welcome
to provide additional templates for various contexts or to start a
discussion about existing templates.*

### Germany

In Germany, the legislation for the speed limit distinguishes roads
inside from those outside city borders, roads with a central barrier
separation from those without, and special road like living streets and
pedestrian areas. There is no direct connection to the importance of a
road. However in OpenStreetMap, a motorway is supposed to have such a
central barrier separation per default
[\[1\]]()(https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dmotorway). As a
consequence, the speed value only varies between rural and urban
contexts but not between road types, except for motorways, living
streets and pedestrian areas. The two SUMO edge type files are given
next, for the detailed values have a look at the files. References are
mentioned in the table below. The rural type map is the default mapping
when converting OpenStreetMap networks without an explicit typemap.

| highway.motorway       | Autobahn. No legislative speed limit: 44.4 is just a reasonable default. [\[2\]](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dmotorway) is a bit opposite to [\[3\]](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Tag:highway%3Dmotorway) regarding oneway tagging.                                                |

### Templates for additional traffic modes in OpenStreetMap

There are additional templates which should be loaded when importing
pedestrian infrastructure (sidewalks), bike lanes, ship movements and
special railways with some comments below:

- [{{SUMO}}/data/typemap/osmNetconvertPedestrians.typ.xml]({{Source}}data/typemap/osmNetconvertPedestrians.typ.xml)
- [{{SUMO}}/data/typemap/osmNetconvertBicycle.typ.xml]({{Source}}data/typemap/osmNetconvertBicycle.typ.xml)
- [{{SUMO}}/data/typemap/osmNetconvertShips.typ.xml]({{Source}}data/typemap/osmNetconvertShips.typ.xml)
- [{{SUMO}}/data/typemap/osmNetconvertExtraRail.typ.xml]({{Source}}data/typemap/osmNetconvertExtraRail.typ.xml)

If your railways have two tracks but are mapped with a single way in

Only few data is available about the railway types. The most important
document might be the [Eisenbahn-Bau- und Betriebsordnung
(EBO)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bundesrecht/ebo/gesamt.pdf),
but even that did not help me much. So the given values are mostly
personal opinion, except if a reference is given. More references are
very welcome.

## Templates for OpenDrive

The default type map is [{{SUMO}}/data/typemap/opendriveNetconvert.typ.xml]({{Source}}data/typemap/opendriveNetconvert.typ.xml).

There are additional templates which should be loaded when importing
pedestrian infrastructure (sidewalks) and/or bike lanes:

- [{{SUMO}}/data/typemap/opendriveNetconvertPedestrians.typ.xml]({{Source}}data/typemap/opendriveNetconvertPedestrians.typ.xml)
- [{{SUMO}}/data/typemap/opendriveNetconvertBicycle.typ.xml]({{Source}}data/typemap/opendriveNetconvertBicycle.typ.xml)
