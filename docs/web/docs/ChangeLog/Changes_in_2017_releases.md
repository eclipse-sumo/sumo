### Enhancements

- Simulation
  - Added option **--collision.mingap-factor** to control whether collisions are registered when
    the vehicle *minGap* is violated. With the default value of 1.0
    minGap must always be maintained. When setting this to 0 only
    *physical* collisions are registered. #1102
  - Added new [junction model parameters](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#junction_model_parameters) #3148:
    - *jmIgnoreFoeProb, jmIgnoreFoeSpeed* can be used to configure
      right-of-way violations.
    - *jmSigmaMinor* allows configuring driving imperfection
      (dawdling) while passing a minor link.
    - *jmTimegapMinor* configures the minimum time gap when
      passing a minor link ahead of a prioritized vehicle.
    - *jmDriveAfterRedTime* and *jmDriveRedSpeed* allow
      configuring red-light violations depending on the duration
      of the red phase.
  - Added new
    [laneChangeModel-attribute](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#lane-changing_models)

  - Added new
    [laneChangeModel-attribute](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#lane-changing_models)
    *lcSpeedGainRight* to configure the asymmetry between
    thrhesholds when changing for speed gain to the left or to the
    right. #3497
  - [Electric vehicles](../Models/Electric.md) can now be used
    for emission-model (electricity) output by setting `emissionClass="Energy/unknown"`

    now informs about person rides. #3620
  - Vehicles that end their route with a stop on a parkingArea
    (arrivalPos is within the parkingArea bounds) will be assigned a
    new destination after [rerouting to another parkingArea](../Simulation/Rerouter.md#rerouting_to_an_alternative_parking_area)
    (previously they would drive to the original parkingArea edge
    after finishing their stop). #3647
  - Rerouters now support the attribute `timeThreshold` which makes their
    activation dependent on on a minimum amount of accumulated
    waiting time. #3669
  - Simulation step length has been decoupled from the action step
    length, which is the vehicle's interval of taking decisions.
    This can be configured globally via the option
    '--default.action-step-length', or per vehicle via the parameter
    'actionStepLength'.

- sumo-gui
  - Transparency is now working for all objects.
  - Junction parameters can now be inspected.
  - Upcoming stops are now shown in the vehicle parameter window and
    also in the network when selecting *show current route*. #3679

    all renamed nodes and edges are written to `<param>` elements with key
    *origId*. #3246
  - connections now support the attribute *speed* to set a custom
    (maximum) speed on intersections. #3460
  - connections now support the attribute *shape* to set a custom
    shape. #2906
  - crossings now support the attribute *shape* to set a custom
    shape. #2906
  - The [new element `<walkingArea>`](../Networks/PlainXML.md#walking_areas)

    different modes of traffic (in conjunction with option **--ptstop-output**).
  - Added options **--osm.all-attributes** {{DT_BOOL}} which can be used to import additional edge
    parameters such as *bridge*, *tunnel* and *postcode*.
  - Parallel lanes of connecting roads are now written as a single
    road in opendrive-output. #2700

- netedit
  - Additional objects (i.e. detectors) as well as POIs and Polygons
    can now be located based on their ID. #3069
  - Connection and Crossing shapes can now be edited visually. #3464

    is given. #2824
  - route alternative output (*.rou.alt.xml*) now contains costs for
    pedestrian stages. #3491

- Tools
  - [osmWebWizard.py](../Tools/Import/OSM.md#osmwebwizardpy)
    can now import public transport (activated by a checkbox on the
    settings tab). If pedestrians are imported as well they may
    elect to use public transport to shorten their walks.
  - added new tool
    [filterDistrics.py](../Tools/District.md#filterdistrictspy)
    to generate district (TAZ) files that are valid for a given
    vehicle class
  - [traceExporter.py](../Tools/TraceExporter.md) can now built
    a direct socket connection to sumo and can filter fcd output for
    regions and times.
  - [flowrouter.py](../Tools/Detector.md#flowrouterpy)
    improvements:
    - route and flow ids now include source and target edge ids
      for better readability. #3434
    - turn-around flow can now be limited using the new option **--max-turn-flow** {{DT_INT}}
  - Added new tool [**tls_csvSignalGroup.py**](../Tools/tls.md#tls_csvsignalgroupspy) for importing traffic light definitions from csv input. The input format aims to be similar to the        representation used by traffic engineers. Thanks
    to Mirko Barthauer for the contribution.

- TraCI
  - return value of trafficlights.getControlledLinks is now a list
    of lists (of links) for the C++ client as well
  - python client now supports the whole API for
    *vehicle.setAdaptedTraveltime* and *vehicle.setEffort*
    (resetting custom values or setting with default time range) by
    using default arguments.

    !!! note
        The order of parameters had to be changed to allow this. Old code will still work but trigger a warning.

### Other

- The SUMO license changed to the [Eclipse Public License Version 2](https://eclipse.org/legal/epl-v20.html)
- The SUMO build process now supports CMake. It is likely that version
0.32.0 will be the last one shipping Visual Studio solutions. Please
have a look at
[Windows CMake](../Installing/Windows_Build.md#manual_cmake_configuration) for
information on how to build SUMO on Windows with CMake. There are
also helper scripts in preparation at [{{SUMO}}/tools/build_config]({{Source}}tools/build_config) for instance `tools/build_config/buildMSVS15Project.py`.

- Simulation
  - **chargingstations-output** now writes times as seconds rather
    than milliseconds.
  - Default value of option **--pedestrian.striping.stripe-width** changed to *0.64* (previously 0.65).
    This allows vehicles with default width to pass a pedestrian on
    a road with default width.
  - preliminary version of [libsumo](../Libsumo.md) is
    available for experimental building of your own apps using SUMO
    as a "library" (calling its functions directly without TraCI)

  - default font changed to [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
  - Removed OpenGL visualisation option *Antialias*
  - E3-Entry and -Exit detectors are now drawn in darker color to better distinguish them from traffic lights. #3378

- netconvert
  - The element `<customShape>` is no longer supported. Instead `<connection>` and `<crossing>` support the
    *shape* attribute. To set a custom shape for walkingAreas, the
    new element `<walkingArea>` may be used.

- TraCI
  - TraCI version is now 17

- Documentation
  - Documented [simulation object right-click menus](../sumo-gui.md#object_properties_right-click-functions)

  - All `<param>` values of simulation objects (i.e. TLS) can now be
    inspected. #3098
  - Calibrators can now be defined for specific lanes not just for
    the whole edge. #2434

    !!! caution
        To obtain the old behavior, calibrators must use the attribute `edge`. When using the attribute `lane` the new behavior is activated.

  - When using the [Sublane model](../Simulation/SublaneModel.md), the lateral offset
    of left and right vehicle side as well as the rightmost and
    leftmost sublane are listed in the vehicle parameter dialog.
  - Added button for calibrating lane/edge colors to the current
    value range. #2464

    which are defined using attributes *lane* and *pos* now accept
    the optional attribute *posLat* for specifying lateral offset
    relative to the lane. #3339. These attributes are automatically added
    as [generic parameters](../Simulation/GenericParameters.md)
    retrievable via TraCI.

    now support the attribute *id* to specify the id of the newly
    created node. Two-way roads can be split with the same node by
    using the same id in two split definitions. #3192
  - Variable lane widths are now taken into account when importing
    OpenDrive networks. The new option **--opendrive.min-width** {{DT_FLOAT}} is used to determine which
    parts of a lane are not usable by the vehicles (*default 1.8m*). #3196
  - Added option **--tls.red.time** {{DT_TIME}} for building a red phase at traffic lights that do
    not have a conflicting stream (i.e. roads with a a pedestrian
    crossing in a network that is not meant for pedestrian
    simulation). The new default value is 5 seconds. #1748
  - Added option **--tls.allred.time** {{DT_TIME}} for building all-red phases after every yellow
    phase. #573
  - Added option **--walkingareas** to allow [generation of walkingareas](../Simulation/Pedestrians.md#walkingareas) in
    networks without pedestrian crossings. #3253
  - Added option **--opposites.guess.fix-lengths** {{DT_BOOL}} to ensure that opposite lane information can be
    set for curved roads. (see
    [Simulation/OppositeDirectionDriving\#Limitations](../Simulation/OppositeDirectionDriving.md#limitations)).
  - Custom lane shapes [can now be defined](../Networks/PlainXML.md#lane-specific_definitions). #2250
  - Added options **--tls.min-dur** {{DT_TIME}} and **--tls.max-dur** {{DT_TIME}} for defining the time range of non-static
    traffic lights. #3329
  - The option **--proj.scale** now accepts arbitrary floats and can be used to
    scale the output network. #3351

- netedit
  - [POIs and Polygons](../Netedit/elementsShape.md#polygon) can
    now be defined with a new editing mode. #1667
  - Minimum and maximum phase duration for actuated traffic lights
    can now be defined. #831
  - Added button for calibrating lane/edge colors to the current
    value range. #2464

- TraCI
  - Support for multiple clients. #3105
  - Added function *vehicle.getAccumulatedWaitingTime* to retrieve
    the waiting time collected over the interval **--waiting-time-memory**. #999
  - Added many value retrieval functions to the C++ client. Thanks
    to Raphael Riebl for the patch\!
  - New vehicle types can be created dynamically (by duplicating
    existent). -\> *traci.vehicletype.copy()* #3211
  - Added function *person.rerouteTraveltime* to [reroute pedestrians](../TraCI/Change_Person_State.md#command_0xce_change_person_state). #3352

  - [osmWebWizard.py](../Tools/Import/OSM.md#osmwebwizardpy)
    now generates scenarios with actuated traffic lights
  - [osmWebWizard.py](../Tools/Import/OSM.md#osmwebwizardpy)
    now generates traffic with more realistic speed distribution
  - flowrouter.py now supports [specifying route restrictions to
    resolve ambiguities](../Tools/Detector.md#ambiguity).
  - When setting
    [randomTrips.py](../Tools/Trip.md#randomtripspy) option **--vehicle-class**,

  - [Electric vehicles](../Models/Electric.md) are now
    initialized with a maximum capacity of 35kWh and and a half full
    battery by default (before, the default was 0 which always made
    it necessary to define this).
  - **--vehroute-output** now includes additional vehicle attributes such as *departLane*
    and *departSpeed* to facilitate scenario replaying.
  - Increased maximum possible insertion flow when using
    *departLane* values *free,allowed* or *best* on multi-lane
    edges. #3000
  - Improvements to lateral-gap keeping when using the [sublane model](../Simulation/SublaneModel.md):
    - Vehicles now attempt to equalize left and right gaps if
      there is insufficient lateral space #2932
    - The semantics of attribute `minGapLat` where changed to define the
      desired gap at 50km/h and do not grow beyond that speed
      (before that threshold was at 100km/h)
    - Vehicles now ignore follower vehicles behind the midpoint of
      their own length in regard to lateral gap keeping.
  - Added option **--max-num-teleports** {{DT_INT}} which can abort the simulation after a number of
    teleports is exceeded. #3003

    menu. #2973
  - When running the simulation with option **--duration-log.statistics**, the average travel
    speed of completed trips is shown in the network parameter
    dialog.
  - For long-running simulations the time displays can now show
    elapsed days. #2889

- netconvert
  - Networks imported from
    [DlrNavteq](../Networks/Import/DlrNavteq.md)-format now
    process *prohibited_manoeuvres* and *connected_lanes* input
    files. #738
  - Edge types are now imported from a *.net.xml* file. #2508
  - Added option **--opendrive.curve-resolution** {{DT_FLOAT}} for setting the level of detail when importing
    road geometries from parmeterized curves. #2686
  - Node shape computation (especially stop line position) can now
    be influenced by setting edge geometries that do not extend to
    the node position.
    - To deal with ambiguous stop line information in OpenDrive
      networks, the new option **--opendrive.advance-stopline** {{DT_FLOAT}} may now now be used to affect the
      heuristic that computes stop line positioning based on the
      border between roads and connecting roads.
  - Bus stops can now be imported from OpenStreetMap using the new
    option **--ptstop-output** {{DT_FILE}}. #2933

- netedit
  - The junction visualization options *show link junction index*
    and *show link tls index* are now working #2955

    100). #2776
  - [Custom edge geometry endpoints](../Netedit/neteditUsageExamples.md#specifying_the_complete_geometry_of_an_edge_including_endpoints)
    values can now be entered in inspect mode. #2012

    client. Thanks to Raphael Riebl for the patch.
  - Added *vehicle.changeTarget* to the C++ client.
  - To allow vehicles to run a red light, speedmode *7* can now be
    used instead of *14*. This is much safer as it avoids rear-end
    collisions.
  - Vehicles can now stop at a named ParkingArea or ChargingStation.
    The methods *traci.vehicle.setParkingAreaStop,
    traci.vehicle.setChargingStationStop* were added to the python
    client to simplify this. #2963
  - vehicle function *moveToXY* now supports the special angle value
    *traci.constants.INVALID_DOUBLE_VALUE*. If this is set, the
    angle will not be factored into the scoring of candidate lanes
    and the vehicle will assume the angle of the best found lane.
    For vehicles outside the road network, the angle will be
    computed from the old and new position. #2262
  - Vehicles now support [retrieval of battery device parameters and retrieval of riding persons and containers as well as retrieval of laneChangeModel parameters](../TraCI/Vehicle_Value_Retrieval.md#device_and_lanechangemodel_parameter_retrieval_0x7e)

    in a vehicle which are on that edge. #2865
  - The TraCI python client now supports
    [StepListeners](../TraCI/Interfacing_TraCI_from_Python.md#adding_a_steplistener).

    take arbitrary strings as index and has improved signal group
    handling, thanks to Harald Schaefer
  - more tools (including osmWebWizard) are python3 compatible

  - TraCI version is now 15
  - some TraCI constants have been renamed
    - CMD_SIMSTEP2 to CMD_SIMSTEP
    - \*AREAL_DETECTOR\* to \*LANEAREA\*
    - \*MULTI_ENTRY_EXIT_DETECTOR\* TO \*MULTIENTRYEXIT\*

- Miscellaneous

    lanes is still possible using either the netconvert option **--no-internal-links** or
    the simulation option **--no-internal-links**
  - The compile-option **--enable-memcheck** and the corresponding nvwa package were
    removed. Checking for memory leaks should be done using the

    value has been reduced from *2.0* to *1.73* correspondingly
    (reproducing the old behavior at 100km/h).

- MESO-GUI
  - Fixed invalid coloring of the gap between lanes. #1428

- duarouter

  - [sumolib.net](../Tools/Sumolib.md) now returns consistent
    values for *edge.getShape()*: the center-line of all lanes.
    Previously, the raw edge shape used in netconvert was returned.
  - [randomTrips.py](../Tools/Trip.md#randomtripspy) now works
    correctly when giving the options **--via, --validate** at the same time. #2821

- Miscellaneous
  - The [special sub-string *TIME*](../Basics/Using_the_Command_Line_Applications.md#writing_files)
    in output file names is now working on Windows.
  - Various fixes concerning the binary XML format #2650, #2651

### Enhancements

- Simulation
  - Added definition of [parking areas](../Simulation/ParkingArea.md) and functionality for
    [rerouting in search of a free parking space](../Simulation/Rerouter.md#rerouting_to_an_alternative_parking_area).
    Many thanks to Mirco Sturari for this contribution.
  - Added new output option **--stop-output** {{DT_FILE}} for generating [output on vehicle stops (for public transport, logistics, etc.)](../Simulation/Output/StopOutput.md)
  - Vehicles that are inserted with `departPos="last"` now depart at the end of the
    lane when there are no leader vehicles. This reduces the overall
    variance in depart positions. #2571
  - The **--step-log-output** now includes statistics on time spend in TraCI functions. #2698
  - When a [vClass is specified for a vehicle type](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#vehicle_emission_classes),
    this information is used to [assign a default emissionClass](../Vehicle_Type_Parameter_Defaults.md) from
    the [HBEFA3 model](../Models/Emissions/HBEFA3-based.md)
    (Before all vehicles had class
    ["HBEFA2/P_7_7"](../Models/Emissions/HBEFA-based.md) by
    default, even bicycles). The default class for passenger
    vehicles is now "HBEFA3/PC_G_EU4".
  - Output files of the
    [MultiEntryExitDetector](../Simulation/Output/Multi-Entry-Exit_Detectors_(E3).md)
    now include *timeLoss* information. #2703
  - Output files of the
    [LaneAreaDetector](../Simulation/Output/Lanearea_Detectors_(E2).md)
    now include *timeLoss* information. #2703
  - Added option **--load-state.remove-vehicles ID1\[,ID2\]\*** for removing vehicles from a loaded state. #2774
  - Pedestrians now use the *speedDev* attribute of their type to
    vary their walking speed. #2792
  - [tripinfo-output](../Simulation/Output/TripInfo.md#generated_output)
    now includes the attribute *speedFactor* which may have been
    chosen randomly when loading the vehicle.
  - Output precision is automatically increased whenever simulating
    with step-lengths below 10ms. #2816
  - E1 detectors now support the attribute *vTypes* for collecting
    type specific measurements. The attribute *splitByType* is no
    longer supported.

- sumo-gui
  - Added new option **--window-pos** {{DT_INT}},{{DT_INT}} for specifying the initial window placement.
  - Added new button to the object locator dialog that allows
    toggling selection status. #2687
  - Parking vehicles are now listed in the vehicle locator dialog.
    This can be disabled using a new menu option. Teleporting
    vehicles can optionally be listed as well #2750
  - Vehicles can now be colored *by time loss* (accumulated over the
    whole route). The time loss is also shown in the vehicle
    parameter dialog.

- MESO
  - Added new option **--meso-minor-penalty** {{DT_TIME}} for applying a time penalty when passing a
    minor link. This may be used to model slow down on approach or
    even intersection delays when running without **--meso-junction-control**. #2640
  - When using the option **--meso-tls-penalty** {{DT_FLOAT}} to model mesoscopic traffic lights, the
    maximum capacity of edges is now reduced according to the
    proportion of green-time and cycle time at controlled
    intersection. #2753

- MESO-GUI
  - The number of queues for the current segment is now shown in the
    edge parameter dialog
  - The latest headway for the current segment is now shown in the
    edge parameter dialog

- netconvert
  - Pedestrian rail crossings are now working. #2654
  - Added new option **--geometry.check-overlap** {{DT_FLOAT}} for finding edges with overlapping lanes. This
    is typically a sign of faulty inputs. The accompanying option **--geometry.check-overlap.vertical-threshold** {{DT_FLOAT}}
    filters out edges that are separated vertically by at least the
    given value (default *4.0*). #2648
  - The options **--keep-edges.explicit, --keep-edges.input-file** now allow for white-listing in combination with
    other removal options (edges are kept if listed explicitly or if
    any other keep-condition is met). #2680
  - Added new option **--osm.oneway-spread-right** {{DT_BOOL}} for setting the default
    [spreadType](../Networks/PlainXML.md#edge_descriptions)
    to *right* for one-way edges (i.e. motorways).
  - The
    [`<split>`](../Networks/PlainXML.md#road_segment_refining)-element
    now supports the new attributes *idBefore, idAfter* to determine
    the ids of the newly created edges. #2731
  - Added new option **--reserved-ids** {{DT_FILE}} for loading a selecting of node and edge ids
    that shall be avoided in the output network.
  - When importing networks from
    [DlrNavteq](../Networks/Import/DlrNavteq.md) format, the
    new option **--construction-date YYYY-MM-DD** can now be used to interpret the readiness of roads
    under construction.
  - Networks exported to
    [DlrNavteq](../Networks/Export.md#dlrnavteq) format now
    contain additional information: bridge/tunnel information, *form
    of way*, ZIP code, prohibited_manoeuvres, connected_lanes
  - Warnings are now issued when steep grades are present in the
    road network. The warning threshold can be configured using the
    new option **geometry.max-grade** {{DT_FLOAT}}.
  - <laneOffset\> data is now imported from OpenDrive networks

- netedit
  - Added new option **--window-pos** {{DT_INT}},{{DT_INT}} for specifying the initial window placement.
  - new [hotkeys](../Netedit/index.md#hotkeys) implemented. #2694
  - New icons for edit modes. #2612
  - Added new button to the object locator dialog that allows
    toggling selection status. #2687

- od2trips
  - Added new option **--flow-output.probability** {{DT_BOOL}} for generating probabilistic flows instead of
    evenly spaced flows. Thanks to Dominik Buse for the patch.

- duarouter
  - Added option **persontrip.walkfactor** {{DT_FLOAT}} to account for pedestrian delays in [intermodal routing](../IntermodalRouting.md#intermodal_cost_function). #2856


- TraCI
  - Added functions *person.getStage, person.getRemainingStages*,
    *person.getVehicle* and *person.getEdges* to the API, the python
    client and the C++ client. #1595
  - Added functions *person.add*, *person.appendWalkingStage*,
    *person.appendDrivingStage*, *person.appendWaitingStage*,
    person.removeStage'', *person.removeStages, person.setColor,
    person.setLength, person.setHeight, person.setWidth,
    person.setMinGap, person.setType* and *person.setSpeed* to the
    API, the python client and the C++ client. #2688
  - The python client now supports *vehicle.getPosition3D*.
  - Added the functions *vehicle.getLine* and *vehicle.setLine* to
    the python client and the C++ client [(to be used for public transport)](../Specification/Persons.md#riding) #2719
  - Added the functions *vehicle.getVia* and *vehicle.setVia* to the
    python client and the C++ client (affects subsequent rerouting
    calls) #2729
  - Added the functions *polygon.getFilled* and *polygon.setFilled*
    to the python client

- Tools
  - [route_departOffset.py](../Tools/Routes.md#route_departoffset)
    now supports additional options for departure time modification
    based on arrival edge. #2568
  - [sumolib.net](../Tools/Sumolib.md) now supports the new
    function *edge.getRawShape()* to retrieve the shape used by
    netconvert. #2742

- Miscellaneous
  - All applications now support the option **--precision** {{DT_INT}} to specify the output
    precision as number of decimal places for floating point output.
    For lon/lat values this is configured separately using option **--precision.geo** {{DT_INT}}.
