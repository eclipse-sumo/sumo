  - Added a new tool
    [generateTurnRatios.py](../Tools/Turns.md#generateturnratiospy)
    for generating turning ratios according to a given route file. Issue #1666
  - The option cost modifier in
    [duaIterate.py](../Tools/Assign.md#duaiteratepy) is
    removed, since it is used for specific projects. Ticket #5594 is open
    to check the respective content for publication and to extend
    the cost modifier function.
  - Added [randomTrips.py](../Tools/Trip.md#edge_probabilities)
    options **--angle-factor** {{DT_FLOAT}} and **--angle** {{DT_FLOAT}} to modify trip probabilities by direction of
    travel. Issue #5642

### Other

- TraCI
  - Function *person.getStage* now returns a TraCIStage object instead of an integer denoting the stage type. #5495
  - Functions *person.appendWalkingStage*,
    *person.appendWaitingStage* now send duration value as a double
    in line with all other time values. #5708
  - Fixed inconsistency in client data model for routing results
    (TraCIStage). In the python client, the stage member which
    describes the stage type is now called *type* instead of
    *stageType* in line with the other clients. #5502
  - Function *vehicle.getNextStops* now includes the current stop if
    the vehicle is stopped. This case can be distinguished by the
    first bit ('reached').

- netconvert
  - Network version is now 1.3
  - In the previous version, setting options **--tls.guess --tls.join** activated a heuristic
    that could create joint controllers for clusters of uncontrolled
    nodes (which would not be guessed as controlled individually).
    Now this heuristic must be activated explicitly using option **--tls.guess.joining**.

- netedit
  - Changed button in allow/disallow-dialog from *allow only
    non-road vehicles* to *allow only road vehicles* vClasses. Issue #5526

- netgenerate

  - lanechange-output now includes *maneuverDistance* when using the sublane model. Issue #4940

  - Time losses due to passing intersections from a non-priority road are now anticipated when routing even when no vehicle has driven there previously. The anticipated loss can be configured using the new option **--weights.minor-penalty** {{DT_FLOAT}} (new default 1.5, previous behavior when set to 0). Issue #2202.
  - Vehicles approaching a stop with *parking=true* now signal their intention by activating the blinker. When exiting from such a stop in dense traffic they signal their intention by activating the blinker. Issue #5126

    - Trains can now reverse on bidirectional edges without the definition of a `<stop>`. Issue #5213
    - RailSignal logic no longer requires all railway switch nodes to be of type *railSignal*. Instead they can be guarded by other railSignal nodes along the incoming tracks. Issue #5091

### Other

- Simulation
  - The default [algorithm for averaging road speed to estimate
    rerouting travel
    times](../Demand/Automatic_Routing.md#edge_weights) was
    changed from *exponential average (0.5)* to *moving average
    (180s)*. This is better suited for averaging traffic light
    cycles in urban road networks. To restore the old behavior, the
    option **--device.rerouting.adaptation-weight 0.5** can be used. Issue #4975

- netconvert
  - Turn-arounds are no longer built at geometry-like nodes by
    default (when there is a node but no intersection so there would
    only be straight connections and turn-arounds). The old behavior
    can be restored by setting option **--no-turnarounds.geometry false**. Issue #5121
  - The default priorities for different railway edge types imported
    from OSM haven been changed so that all types use a different
    priority value.
  - The assigned edge speed for unrestricted motorways was lowered
    to 142km/h (from 300km/h) to better reflect real world speed
    distributions (together with the default speed factor
    distribution). Also, the default motorway speed was lowered from
    160km/h to 142km/h for the same reason. Issue #5434

- TraCI
  - TraCI Version is now 20
  - Function *trafficlight.setCompleteRedYellowGreeenDefinition* now
    expects the 5th component *next* to be a list of integers when
    defining phases. Function
    '*'trafficlight.getCompleteRedYellowGreeenDefinition* now
    returns a list of integers as the 5th component (next) when
    defining phases. Custom clients must be patched to handle this.
  - Function *trafficlight.setCompleteRedYellowGreeenDefinition* now
    accepts *name* as an optional 6th component when defining
    phases. Function
    '*'trafficlight.getCompleteRedYellowGreeenDefinition* now
    returns *name* as the 6th component when defining phases. Custom
    clients must be patched to handle this.
  - TraaS function *Simulation.findRoute* now returns SumoStage
    object (containing all data returned by the TraCI API) instead
    of SumoStringList with just the edge IDs
  - TraaS function *Simulation.findRoute* now returns
    LinkedList<SumoStage\> (containing all data returned by the TraCI
    API) instead of LinkedList<SumoStringList\>

- Documentation
  - Added Tutorial for [Manhattan
    Mobility](../Tutorials/Manhattan.md).
  - The [TraaS](../TraCI/TraaS.md) library is now documented
    within the wiki.
