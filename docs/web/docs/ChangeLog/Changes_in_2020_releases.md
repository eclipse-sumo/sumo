  - Added [API for coupling taxi dispatch algorithms](../Simulation/Taxi.md#traci). Issue #6526

- Tools
  - Added [randomTrips.py](../Tools/Trip.md) option **--via-edge-types**. When this option is set to a list of types, edges of this type are not used for departure or arrival unless they are on the fringe. This can be used to prevent departure on the middle of a motorway. Issue #7505
  - Added new tool [generateRailSignalConstraints.py](../Tools/Railways.md#generaterailsignalconstraintspy) to generated constraint input for rain signals from a route file. Issue #7436
  - Added [traceExporter.py](../Tools/TraceExporter.md) option **--shift** which allows shifting output coordinates by a fixed amount (i.e. to avoid negative values).

- [macOS launchers](../Downloads.md#application_launchers) added for **sumo-gui**, **netedit** and the **osmWebWizard**. This allows to set **sumo-gui** as the default application to open `.sumocfg` files (to open a simulation by just double clicking a file) on macOS.
- extractTest.py now extracts tests for all variants (sumo, meso) which have specific outputs and got a lot better picking up all options

  - Retrieval of prior person stages now includes departure time and travel time. Issue #7274
  - Added 'simulation.getVersion' to libsumo and C++ client. Issue #7282
  - Function ['person.moveToXY'](../TraCI/Change_Person_State.md#move_to_xy_0xb4) is now officially supported whenever a person is walking or stopped. It can be used to move a person to an arbitrary place and will update the route accordingly. Issue #2872, #7367, #7382
  - Added function 'person.getLaneID'. Issue #7394

### Other
- Simulation
  - Route attribute 'period' was renamed to 'cycleTime'. Issue #7168

- TraCI
  - In the python client, function vehicle.getLeader can now optionally return the pair ("", -1) instead of 'None' if no leader is found. The new behavior can be enabled by calling function traci.setLegacyGetLeader(False). In later versions this will be the default behavior. The return value 'None' is deprecated. Issue #7013
  - The function 'libsumo.vehicle.getNextStops' now returns a list of StopData objects rather than a list of tuples (the same result type returned by getStops) but different from the return type of 'traci.vehicle.getNextStops'.

  - Added option **--no-turnarounds.except-turnlane** which causes turnlanes to be built only if there is an exclusive (left) turn lane. Issue #6444
  - Added option **--tls.group-signals** which assigns the same signal index to connections that share the same sequence signal states. Added option **--tls.ungroup-signals** which reverts grouping and assigns a distinct signal index to every connection. Issue #2958
  - Symbolic speed limits in OSM are now supported for all countries. Issue #6566
  - Added option **--fringe.guess** to heuristically mark nodes on the outer network boundary. Issue #6624
  - Added option **--no-turnarounds.fringe** to prevent building of turnaround-connections at the network fringe. Issue #6621
  - Added option **--ptstop-output.no-bidi** to skip automatic generation of a bidi-stop on a bidirectional rail edge. Issue #6598

- netgenerate
  - Fringe nodes are now automatically marked in grid networks when setting **--grid.attach-length** > 0. Issue #6622

- duarouter
  - The maximum [map-matching](../Demand/Shortest_or_Optimal_Path_Routing.md#mapmatching) distance is now configurable using option **--mapmatch.distance**. Also, mapmatching with large distance is now computationally efficient. Issue #6476
  - Trip, flows, personTrips and walks with attributes `fromJunction`,`toJunction` and `viaJunctions` are now supported when setting option **--junction-taz**. Issue #6474
  - Trips can now be written with attributes `fromJunction` and `toJunction` and `viaJunctions` by setting option **--write-trips.junctions**. Issue #6474
  - When using trip attributes `fromXY`, `fromLonLat`, etc. the given positions can now be mapped to junctions instead of edges by setting option **--mapmatch.junctions**. Issue #6475

- jtrrouter
  - Added option **--sources-are-sinks** (shortcut **-S**). When this option is set, all flows will terminate upon reaching the from-edge of another flow. Issue #6601
  - Added option **--discount-sources** (shortcut **-D**). When this option is set, the flow departing at an edge will be reduced by the amount of traffic that has reached this edge from upstream flows. When combined with option **--sources-are-sinks**, upstream flows will terminate at a downstream edge when the source flow number has been reached. This can be used to build a scenario from flow counts at arbitrary locations. Issue #6601

- TraCI / Libsumo
  - Added context subscription filter that filters in a given range around the vehicles route 'addSubscriptionFilterLateralDistance'. Issue #6287
  - Libsumo now supports context subscription filters

- Tools
  - [duaIterate.py](../Demand/Dynamic_User_Assignment.md#iterative_assignment_dynamic_user_equilibrium) now supports intermodal scenarios. Issue #6403
  - Added [duaIterate.py](../Demand/Dynamic_User_Assignment.md#iterative_assignment_dynamic_user_equilibrium) option **--measure-vtypes** to improve accuracy of measured travel times when different vehicle types can use different lanes.
  - Added [tileGet.py](../Tools/Misc.md#tilegetpy) to retrieve image tiles from public servers. Issue #6279
  - Added [randomTrips.py](../Tools/Trip.md) option **--personrides LINE** to generated person rides with the give line id.
  - Added [randomTrips.py](../Tools/Trip.md) option **--junction-taz** to generated trips, flows, personTrips and walks between junctions. Issue #6474
  - Added the ability to download Satellite image backgrounds (using [tileGet.py](../Tools/Misc.md#tilegetpy)) in [osmWebWizard](../Tools/Import/OSM.md#osmwebwizardpy). Issue #6481
  - Added new tool [jtcrouter.py](../Tools/Turns.md#jtcrouterpy) to build a traffic demand scenario based on turn-count data (this uses [jtrrouter](../jtrrouter.md) in the background). Issue #6229
  - Added new tool [routeSampler.py](../Tools/Turns.md#routesamplerpy) to build a traffic demand scenario based on turn-count and edge-count data. This tool samples from a given set of routes to meet the detected counts. Issue #6616
  - Added new tool [turnCount2EdgeCount.py](../Tools/Turns.md#turncount2edgecountpy) which converts turn-count data into edge-count data. Issue #6619


### Other
- Build
  - removed autotools build

- sumo-gui
  - the settings file no longer accepts the element breakpoints-file (command line option is still there)
  - renamed attributes in the settings (breakpoint.value to breakpoint.time and decal.filename to decal.file)
  - Default settings values 'show link junction index' and 'show link tls index' changed because their interpretation varies after #6376. Old GUI-setting files must be updated to achieve the default look.

- Simulation
  - When defining [automated switching between traffic light programs](../Simulation/Traffic_Lights.md#defining_program_switch_times_and_procedure), switch times are no longer wrapped to fit into a single day (modulo). The replace the old behavior, set the new waut attribute `period="86400"`. Issue #6522

- TraCI
  - traci.lane.getLinks (python) now returns the extended descriptions by default, the older behavior should not be used anymore (but is still available using a second parameter)
