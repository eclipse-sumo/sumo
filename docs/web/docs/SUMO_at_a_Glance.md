title: SUMO at a Glance

## About

"**S**imulation of **U**rban **MO**bility", or "SUMO" for short, is an
open source, microscopic, multi-modal traffic simulation. It allows to
simulate how a given traffic demand which consists of single vehicles
moves through a given road network. The simulation allows to address a
large set of traffic management topics. It is purely microscopic: each
vehicle is modelled explicitly, has an own route, and moves individually
through the network. Simulations are deterministic by default but there
are various options for [introducing randomness](Simulation/Randomness.md).

If you download the SUMO package, you will note that it contains further
applications besides SUMO. These applications are used to import/prepare
road networks and demand data for being used in SUMO, see [Included Applications](#included_applications) for a more verbose
list.

national and international research
[projects](Other/Projects.md). The applications included:

- traffic lights evaluation
- route choice and re-routing
- evaluation of traffic surveillance methods
- [simulation of vehicular communications](Topics/V2X.md)
- traffic forecast

## History

The development of SUMO started in the year 2000. The major reason for
the development of an open source, microscopic road traffic simulation
was to support the traffic research community with a tool with the
ability to implement and evaluate own algorithms. The tool has no need
for regarding all the needed things for obtaining a complete traffic
simulation such as implementing and/or setting up methods for dealing
with road networks, demand, and traffic controls. By supplying such a
tool, the DLR wanted to i) make the implemented algorithms more
comparable by using a common architecture and model base, and ii) gain
additional help from other contributors.

## Software design criteria

Two major design goals are approached: the software shall be fast and it
shall be portable. Due to this, the very first versions were developed
to be run from the command line only - no graphical interface was
supplied at first and all parameter had to be inserted by hand. This
should increase the execution speed by leaving off slow visualization.
Also, due to these goals, the software was split into several parts.
Each of them has a certain purpose and must be run individually. This is
something that makes SUMO different to other simulation packages where,
for instance, the dynamical user assignment is made within the
simulation itself, not via an external application like here. This split
allows an easier extension of each of the applications within the
package because each is smaller than a monolithic application that does
everything. Also, it allows the usage of faster data structures, each
adjusted to the current purpose, instead of using complicated and
ballast-loaded ones. Still, this makes the usage of SUMO a little bit
uncomfortable in comparison to other simulation packages. As there are
still other things to do, we are not thinking of a redesign towards an
integrated approach by now.
