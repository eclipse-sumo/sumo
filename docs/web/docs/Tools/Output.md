All of the tools described below exist in *tools/output* directory.

## attributeStats.py

Computes statistics on arbitrary numerical attributes in an xml
document. (eg. attribute *timeLoss* for element *tripinfo* in
[tripinfo-output](../Simulation/Output/TripInfo.md)) and writes the
results to standard output. When the attribute contains time data in HH:MM:SS format, the values will automatically be converted to seconds.

```
python tools/output/attributeStats --element tripinfo --attribute timeLoss input.xml
```

- If option **--element** (**-e**) is set to a comma-separated list of elements, only these elements will be read. Otherwise all elements will be parsed
- If option **--attribute** (**-a**) is set to a comma-separated list of attributes, only these attributes will be read. Otherwise all attributes will be parsed
- It is also possible to give multiple files as input as a space separated list or via shell expansion (i.e. `*.input.xml`)
- If option **--id-attribute** (**-i**) is set, the minimum and maximum values of each attribute will be annotated with the corresponding id value
- With option **--hist-output** {{DT_FILE}}, a histogram data file (e.g. for plotting with gnuplot) is generated.
  - option **--binwidth INT** (**-b**) defines the binning width for the histogram
- With option **--abs** the output will include statistics on absolute values
- With option **--xml-output** {{DT_FILE}}, A file with statistical measures for all processed attributes is written
- With option **--full-output** {{DT_FILE}}, A collected attribute values are recorded with their corresponding ids
- Output precision can be set with option **--precision** (**-p**)

## attributeDiff.py

Computes difference between numerical attributes in two xml files with the same structure (eg. attribute *timeLoss* for element *vehicleTripStatistics* in [statistic-output](../Simulation/Output/StatisticOutput.md)) and writes the
results to standard output. When the attribute contains time data in HH:MM:SS format, the values will automatically be converted to seconds.

```
python tools/output/attributeDiff file1.xml file2.xml --xml-output differences.xml
```

- If option **--element** (**-e**) is set to a comma-separated list of elements, only these elements will be read. Otherwise all elements will be parsed
- If option **--attribute** (**-a**) is set to a comma-separated list of attributes, only these attributes will be read. Otherwise all attributes will be parsed
- With option **--xml-output** {{DT_FILE}}, A file with statistical measures for all processed attributes is written. If this option is not set or combined with option **--verbose**, the results are written as plain text to the console.
- **--only-first-output** (**-m**): Write all element and attributes that occur only in the first input to FILE
- **--only-second-output** (**-M**): Write all element and attributes that occur only in the second input to FILE

### grouping attributes

If is often useful to compare files where the same elements occur multiple times but are distinguishable by some further attribute (i.e. vehicle id in [tripinfo-output](../Simulation/Output/TripInfo.md)). To compare elements with similar ids, the option **--id-attribute** can be used to set a list of attributes. The following example calls computes the differences of all tripinfo attributes for each individual vehicle that occurred in both files (i.e. from two simulation runs with different seeds):

```
python tools/output/attributeDiff tripinfos1.xml tripinfos2.xml --xml-output differences.xml -i id
```

!!! note
    The tool [tripinfoDiff.py](#tripinfodiffpy) serves the same special use case.

If a list of id attributes is set, those attributes may occur at different levels of the xml element hierarchy and parent values will be applied for the child element comparison. The following example makes use of this to compare edges with the same id and in the same time interval for [edgedata-output](../Simulation/Output/Lane-_or_Edge-based_Traffic_Measures.md):

```
python tools/output/attributeDiff edgedata1.xml edgedata2.xml --xml-output differences.xml -i begin,id
```

!!! note
    The last example is very similar to [netdumpdiff.py](#netdumpdiffpy) and [edgeDataDiff.py](#edgedatadiffpy)

## attributeCompare.py

Computes statistics on numerical attributes in multiple xml files with the same structure (eg. attribute *timeLoss* for element *vehicleTripStatistics* in [statistic-output](../Simulation/Output/StatisticOutput.md)) and writes the
results to standard output. The tool works very similar to [attributeDiff.py](#attributediffpy) but uses multiple files and computes a wide range of statistics instead of the difference between values.

```
python tools/output/attributeCompare.py file1.xml file2.xml file3.xml --xml-output compared.xml
```

- If option **--element** (**-e**) is set to a comma-separated list of elements, only these elements will be read. Otherwise all elements will be parsed
- If option **--attribute** (**-a**) is set to a comma-separated list of attributes, only these attributes will be read. Otherwise all attributes will be parsed
- If option **--id-attribute** (**-i**) is set, elements are [grouped as explained for attributeDiff.py](#grouping_attributes)
- With option **--xml-output** {{DT_FILE}}, A file with statistical measures for all processed attributes is written. If this option is not set or combined with option **--verbose**, the results are written as plain text to the console.

[vehroute](../Simulation/Output/VehRoutes.md)-like output for lanes
based on [--netstate-dump](../Simulation/Output/RawDump.md) output.
Output data also includes information about the number of lane changes
for each vehicle.

usage:

```
python vehLanes.py <netstate_dump.xml> <output_file>
```

## edgeDataDiff.py

Computes the numerical difference of
[edgeData](../Simulation/Output/Lane-_or_Edge-based_Traffic_Measures.md)
values for each edge and interval. The resulting file can be used to
[visualize changes between two traffic scenarios](../sumo-gui.md#visualizing_edge-related_data). Both
input files must contain the same edges and intervals.

usage:

```
python edgeDataDiff.py <edgeData1.xml> <edgeData2.xml> <diffFile.xml>
```

## vehrouteDiff.py

Computes the difference in travel times between two sets of **--vehroute-output** files. The
files must contain the same vehicles and the same routes and may only
differ in travel times. The must have been generated with the option **--vehroute-output.exit-times**
for the script to work.

usage:

```
python vehrouteDiff.py routes1.rou.xml routes2.rou.xml result.xml
```

## vehrouteCountValidation.py

Computes the mismatch between counting data (in the same format as used by [routeSampler.py](Turns.md#routesamplerpy))
and **--vehroute-output** files. If the vehroute-output was generated with option **--vehroute-output.exit-times**, then time of passing the respective edges is used for the validation of counting data time lines (counting data with multiple time intervals).
Since typically, the total count of vehicles provided in the simulation **--route-files** passes the desired edges, the main value of this tools lies in evaluating the impact of delays (or delayed insertion) on replicating time-dependent counting data.

usage (with turn counts):

```
python vehrouteCountValidation.py -r routes.rou.xml -t input_turns.xml
```

## tripinfoDiff.py

Computes the difference in travel times, route length, time loss,
departure- and arrival times between two sets of **--tripinfo-output** files. The files
should contain the same vehicles.

usage:

```
python tripinfoDiff.py tripinfos1.xml tripinfos2.xml result.xml
```

By default only `<tripinfo>` elements are considered. By setting option **--persons**, the
difference for `<personinfo>` elements is computed instead.

## tripinfoByTAZ.py

Aggregates tripinfo data by origin/destination TAZ. The TAZ data can
either by taken from the original input file (if it contains 'fromTaz'
and 'toTaz' attributes) or from a TAZ file.

```
python tripinfoByTAZ.py -t tripinfos.xml -r trips.xml
python tripinfoByTAZ.py -t tripinfos.xml -z taz.axml
```

By default traveltime (tripinfo attribute 'duration') is aggregated.
Other attributes can be selected using option **--attribute** (e.g. 'routeLength').
Output is given as plain text on the command line or in xml format if
option **--output** is set.

## tripinfoByType.py

Aggregates tripinfo data by vType and person stage type for the given attribute

```
python tripinfoByType.py -t tripinfos.xml -a timeLoss

```

Output is given as plain text on the command line or in xml format if option **--output** is set.

## computeCoordination.py

This tool reads fcd-output and a corridor definition. It computes the fraction of vehicles that passed the corridor without significant slow-down.

Example:
```
python tools/output/computeCoordination.py --fcd-file fcd.xml --filter-route B,C,D,E --entry C --min-speed 5
```
This computes the fraction of vehicles that passed the edges *B,C,D,E* in order (possibly with gaps) and were delayed after passing edge *C* to less then 5m/s.

With option **--full-output** {{DT_FILE}} Each vehicle that passed the corridor is recorded with entry time and the time at which it was delayed (-1 it it was not delayed).

## tripStatistics.py

This script is to calculate the global performance indices according to
**SUMO-based** simulation results. The calculation functions are
directly defined in this script. Basic statistics are delivered, such
as:

- average travel time (s)
- average travel length (m)
- average travel speed (m/s)
- average departure delay (s)
- average waiting time (s)

Besides, this script is also to execute a significance test for
evaluating the results from different assignment methods. The t test and
the Kruskal-Wallis test are available in this script. If not specified,
the Kruskal-Wallis test will be applied with the assumption that data
are not normally distributed.

In order to execute this script, the other two scripts, i.e.
statisticsElements.py and tables.py, are required. They all should be in
the same directory.

In the statisticsElements.py, classes regarding vehicles, their
performance measures, t values, H values as well as functions for
outputs are defined. The chi-square table and the t table are defined in
the tables.py.

An exemplary command is shown below.

```
python tools/output/tripStatistics.py -t <tripinfo files> -o <output file> -e

where -t: name of output files containing vehicle information, generated by SUMO
      -o: define the output file name
      -e: set true for applying the t test (default: false)
      -k: set true for applying the Kruskal-Wallis test (default: false)
```

## computeStoppingPlaceUsage.py
This tool reads stop-output and tracks the number of stopped vehicles over time at stopping places (i.e. parkingArea).
A distinct output file will be created for each stopping place.
If option **--only-changes** is set, only time steps in which the number of stopped vehicles changes, are recorded.

Example:
```
python tools/output/computeStoppingPlaceUsage.py -s stopinfos.xml
```

## computePassengerCounts.py
This tool reads stop-output and generates occupancy-over-time for vehicles
A distinct output file will be created for each vehicle.

Example:
```
python tools/output/computePassengerCounts.py -s stopinfos.xml
```

## parkingSearchTraffic.py
This tool reads [vehroute-output](../Simulation/Output/VehRoutes.md) with [exit-times](../Simulation/Output/VehRoutes.md#further_options) and generates statistics for the time and the distance vehicles
spent on searching parking locations as well as the length of the walking way back.
It evaluates the time and distance between the first reroute and the arrival at the final stop.
It currently outputs only basic statistics (mean, avg, quartiles etc.).

Example:
```
python tools/output/parkingSearchTraffic.py net.net.xml vehroutes.xml
```


## aggregateBatteryOutput.py

Script for aggregate battery outputs in intervals.

Example usage:
```
python tools\output\aggregateBatteryOutput.py -i battery.xml -o batteryAggregatedx.xml -t 60 -v veh0
```

## fcdDiff.py

Computes difference between two [fcd-output files](../Simulation/Output/FCDOutput.md) with regard to their distance in space.
Data points in the files are matched by time and by id (no time shifting is done).

Statistical outputs are printed on the console. It is also possible to write all error values to an xml file.

```
python tools/output/fcdDiff fcd.xml fcd2.xml
```

- If option **--grouped** is set, separate statistics for each vehicle will be printed
- If option **--tripId** is set, vehicles will be matched by attribute `tripId` instead of `id` (requires **--fcd-output.params tripId** to be when generating the fcd-output)
- With option **--xml-output** {{DT_FILE}}, An annotated fcd file with error values is written
