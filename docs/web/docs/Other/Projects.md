  Hubaux from [Laboratory for Computer Communications and Applications
  (LCA)](http://lcawww.epfl.ch), [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch),
  Switzerland
  TraNS is the first open-source project providing a full-blown
  application-centric evaluation framework for VANETs. It has a unique
  set of features necessary to build VANET applications and evaluate
  them in realistic conditions. It comes with a set of ready to use
  examples.

- "Assessment of traffic regulation policies for the minimization of
  pollutants emissions"
  by Mauro Bianchi at [CEFRIEL](http://www.cefriel.it/), Italy.
  This project uses SUMO in combination with EMEP/CORINAIR methodology
  for evaluating the impact of different traffic regulation strategies
  on pollutants emissions. Traffic simulations are performed offline
  for identifying some optimal regulation policies for different local
  traffic conditions, using a simple evolutionary algorithm. We
  hypothesize an online regulation system with a network of sensors
  that is used to recognize the current traffic situations and deploy
  the optimal traffic regulation policies.
- [Fidens – Trust between Cooperative Systems in Application to VANETs](https://web.archive.org/web/20120313075112/http://www.ldv.ei.tum.de/en/research/fidens/)
  This project investigates trust in vehicular networks (VANETs).
  Besides the trust research, it features a simulation environment for
  large scale vehicular network applications. Our typical scenario
  involves about 13000 vehicles per day over 26 weeks. We build on top
  of SUMO and the network simulator Shawn.
  [Shawn](https://github.com/itm/shawn) aims on investigating an
  algorithm in a network while the underlying layers are kept well
  controlled. To do so, it simulates the effects of the underlying
  layers, not their protocols in detail. This makes it especially fast
  and suitable for application developers.
