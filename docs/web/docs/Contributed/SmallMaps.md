Betreff: Frida map pruning

Hello Daniel,
I have added a simple GUI to the script that makes the pruning to the
Frida maps and I believe that is more usable now.
You can find attached the sources and a compiled file for Linux that
you can try out. A lot of information are still hard-coded in the
source code which means that the program is not totally generic but
maybe is useful for a lot of people that are looking for small maps
that can "play"with in SUMO.
The readme file contains some general information.

Regards
Andreas Florides
