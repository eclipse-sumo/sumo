"**S**imulation of **U**rban **MO**bility" (SUMO) is an open source, highly portable, microscopic and continuous traffic simulation package designed to handle large networks. It allows for intermodal simulation including pedestrians and comes with a large set of tools for scenario creation. It is mainly developed by employees of the [Institute of Transportation Systems](https://www.dlr.de/ts) at the [German Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de). SUMO is licensed under the [EPL 2.0](https://eclipse.org/legal/epl-v20.html). The source code may also be made available under the following Secondary
Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the EPL 2.0 are satisfied: [GPL2 or later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-standalone.html).

Please use the [mailing lists](Contact.md) for sharing your results or for asking questions. Answers to some common questions may also be found in the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

# Additional Tools

In addition to the [main applications (sumo, sumo-gui, netedit, netconvert, etc.)](SUMO_at_a_Glance.md#included_applications), there are
over 150 additional tools. They cover topics from traffic network
analysis, demand generation, demand modification to output analysis.
Most of them are written in [python](https://www.python.org/). All tools
can be found in the SUMO-distribution under {{SUMO}}/tools.

For an index of all tools see:

- [Tool index](Tools/index.md)

Below are links to some of the most important/used tools:

- [osmWebWizard](Tools/Import/OSM.md#osmwebwizardpy) - create a simple scenario, in just a few clicks and using your web browser
- [Interfacing TraCI from Python](TraCI/Interfacing_TraCI_from_Python.md) - access a running SUMO simulation using Python
- [sumolib](Tools/Sumolib.md) - Python modules for working with SUMO networks and sumo xml files in general
- [Xml Tools](Tools/Xml.md) - tools for converting SUMO outputs to CSV/Spreadsheet, and vice versa
- [traceExporter.py](Tools/TraceExporter.md) - export mobility traces (FCD output) into different "trace file" formats
- [netdiff.py](Tools/Net.md#netdiffpy) - determine the differences between two networks
- [Visualization Tools](Tools/Visualization.md) - visualize a wide range of simulation outputs in a graphical and friendly way
