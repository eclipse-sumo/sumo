# Parking Areas

Areas for parking outside the road network (either road-side parking or
car parks) can be defined using the `<parkingArea>` element. This accomplishes the
following purposes:

- arbitrary parking positions and angles can be defined to visualize
  fishbone or parallel parking
- parking space outside the road network can be limited to a set
  capacity
- [automatic rerouting to an alternative parking](Rerouter.md#rerouting_to_an_alternative_parking_area) area can be triggered
  whenever a parking area becomes full

# Definition

A road-side parkingArea is defined as in the following:

```xml
<parkingArea id="ParkAreaA" lane="a_0" startPos="200" endPos="250" roadsideCapacity="5" angle="45" length="30"/>
```

Additionally, individual parking spaces can be defined:

```xml
<parkingArea id="ParkAreaB" lane="b_0" startPos="240" endPos="260" roadsideCapacity="0" width="5" length="10" angle="30">
    <space x="853" y="623"/>
    <space x="863" y="618"/>
    <space x="873" y="613"/>
    <space x="883" y="608"/>
    <space x="893" y="603"/>
    <space x="848" y="611" width="4" length="8" angle="120"/>
    <space x="858" y="606" width="4" length="8" angle="120"/>
    <space x="868" y="601" width="4" length="8" angle="120"/>
    <space x="878" y="596" width="4" length="8" angle="120"/>
    <space x="888" y="591" width="4" length="8" angle="120"/>
</parkingArea>
```

The total capacity of a parking area is given by the sum of its
*roadsideCapacity* and the number of its `<space>` elements.

The parkingArea supports the following attributes:

## Custom parking spaces

The space element supports the following attributes:

| Attribute Name | Value Type     | Value Range | Default                                                                  | Description                                     |

| **y**          | float          |             |                                                                          | The y-position in meters of the parking vehicle |
| z              | float          |             | 0                                                                        | The z-position in meters of the parking vehicle |

| length         | float          |             | length value of the parent parking area                                  | The length of the parking space                 |
| angle          | float (degree) |             | absolute angle of the parent parking area (lane angle + angle attribute) | Absolute angle of the parking space             |
| slope          | float (degree) |             | 0                                                                        | Slope angle of the parking space                |

!!! caution
    Please note that parking areas must be added to a config via the *--additional-files* parameter (see {{AdditionalFile}}).

# Letting Vehicles stop at a parking area

To declare a vehicle that stops at a parkingPlace, a `<stop>`-definition must
be part of the vehicle or its route:

```xml
<vehicle id="0" depart="0">
    <route edges="e1 e2 e3"/>
    <stop parkingArea="pa0" duration="20"/>
</vehicle>
```

What is defined here is a vehicle named "0" that stops as at parkingArea
"pa0". Note, that the lane of that parking area must belong to one of
the edges "e1, e2, e3" of the vehicles route.

For a complete list of attributes for the "stop"-element of a vehicle
see
[Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes\#Stops](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#stops_and_waypoints).

# Modelling Maneuvering Times when Entering and Leaving the Parking Space

When setting the (boolean) option **--parking.maneuver**, vehicles will spend extra time on the road when leaving and entering a parkingArea. This time depends on the angle of the parking lot relative to the road lane and can be configured with the vType attribute *maneuverAngleTimes*. This is a comma-separated list of number-triplets of the form *ANGLE ENTERINGTIME LEAVINGTIME*:

```xml
<vType id="example" maneuverAngleTimes="10 3.0 4.0,80 1.6 11.0,110 11.0 2.0,170 8.1 3.0,181 3.0 4.0"/>
```

The value corresponding to the closest angle is used. The value of maneuverAngleTimes is initialized to a vClass-specific value:

- default: `maneuverAngleTimes="10 3 4,80 1 11,110 11 2,170 8 3,181 3 4"`
- truck, trailer, coach, delivery: all times doubled compared to default
- bicycle, moped: `maneuverAngleTimes="181 1 1"`

# Rerouting when the current parkingArea is full

If a vehicle reaches a parkingArea that is filled to capacity it must
wait on the road until a space becomes available or [reroute to a new
parking
area](../Simulation/Rerouter.md#rerouting_to_an_alternative_parking_area).

# Restricting the access to the parking area

In the real world, the access to parkings may be restricted to different kinds of users, such as residents, customers or employees. As these access rights may vary a lot depending on the location,
they are modeled using a separate permission system from the vehicle classes. The access to the parking area can be restricted in the following way:

- The parking area defines a set of accepted badges (keywords) which model single access rights in the attribute **acceptedBadges**, e.g. `acceptedBadges="clients_supermarket employees_supermarket"`
- The vehicles or vehicle types define the set of owned badges which give them access, e.g. `parkingBadges="employees_supermarket home_johndoe"`
- Any parking area which is not restricted (empty *acceptedBadges** attribute) or where at least one of the accepted badges is present in the vehicle or vehicle type definition can be accessed

!!! caution
    Parking badges defined in the vehicle definition override vehicle type settings.

# Importing / Generating Parking Areas

The following tools exist to obtain parking area definitions

- [generateParkingAreas.py](../Tools/Misc.md#generateparkingareaspy): probabilistic generation for a whole network
- [generateParkingLots.py](../Tools/Misc.md#generateparkinglotspy): generate space definitions to fill up a given shape
- [netedit](../Netedit/elementsAdditional.md#parking_areas): define parking areas visually
- [netconvert --parking-output](../netconvert.md#export_1): imports roadside parking areas from OSM
- [SAGA generateParkingAreasFromOSM.py](https://github.com/lcodeca/SUMOActivityGen): imports all kinds of parking areas from OSM

# TraCI

Some information regarding parking areas can be accessed directly using
[traci.simulation.getParameter()
calls](../TraCI/Simulation_Value_Retrieval.md#generic_parameter_retrieval_0x7e).

- **parkingArea.capacity**: total number of parking spaces
  (roadsideCapacity + number of `<space>` elements)
- **parkingArea.occupancy**: number of vehicles parking at this
  parking area
