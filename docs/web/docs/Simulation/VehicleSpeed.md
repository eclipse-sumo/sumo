title: VehicleSpeed
---

There are a wide range of influences on vehicle speed. They are
described in the following. Each of these influences sets an upper bound
on the vehicle speed. The actual speed in any given situation is the
minimum speed of all influences.

# maxSpeed

The [`<vType>-attribute maxSpeed`](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#vehicle_types)
models the maximum speed that a vehicle will travel. It can be thought
of as the maximum speed of the engine.

# desiredMaxSpeed

The [`<vType>-attribute desiredMaxSpeed`](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#vehicle_types)
models the (mean) desired maximum speed that the vehicles drivers of that type wish to use. The actual desired maximum speed of an individual vehicle is computed by multiplying the `maxDesiredSpeed` of its type with the [individual speedFactor](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#speed_distributions) of that vehicle.
The individual desired max speed serves as another upper bound on speed next to the `maxSpeed` and the road speed limit.

The main use of this property is to model speed distributions for vehicles that are not limited by the legal road speed limit (i.e. pedestrians and bicycles). In contrast, regular cars are typically restrained by the speed limit and so their speed distribution is modelled by multiplying their individual speedFactor with the speedLimit. Thus, different [vClasses](../Definition_of_Vehicles%2C_Vehicle_Types%2C_and_Routes.md#abstract_vehicle_class) have different default values for `desiredMaxSpeed`:

- `pedestrian`: 1.39 (5km/h)
- `bicycle`: 5.56 (20km/h)
- all other classes: 2778 (10000km/h)

!!! caution
    Up to version 1.14.1 this property did not exist, and `maxSpeed` was sometimes used to also model the desired speed. This resulted in a constant default maximum speed for all bicycles.

# edge/lane speed and speedFactor

The `speed`-attribute is usually [defined for edges](../Networks/PlainXML.md#edge_descriptions)
but may also [differ among the lanes](../Networks/PlainXML.md#lane-specific_definitions)
of the same edge. It models the legal speed limit.

When approaching an edge with a lower speed limit than the current one,
a vehicle will slow down so as to stay within the new limit at the time
of reaching the new edge.

Each vehicle can be [assigned an individual speed multiplier (speedFactor)](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#speed_distributions)
which then lets it exceed this limit. Since version 1.0.0, vehicles will
have a random speedFactor with a deviation of 0.1 and mean of 1.0 which
means there will be different desired speeds in the vehicle population
by default.

When vehicles are driving freely (unconstrained by other vehicles) they will accelerate until reaching the speed
```
min(maxSpeed, speedFactor * desiredMaxSpeed,  speedFactor * speedLimit)
```

!!! note
    Legacy behavior can be achieved by setting option **--default.speeddev 0**

Since version 0.24.0 it is also possible to define [vClass-specific speed limits for every edge](../Networks/PlainXML.md#vehicle-class_specific_speed_limits).

# Car Following Model

The [car following model](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#car-following_models)
of a vehicle defines its speed in relation the vehicle ahead. The
default model always selects the maximum speed which is *safe* in the
sense of being able to stop in time to avoid a collision.

## Acceleration and Deceleration

All models are subject to constraints in their [acceleration an deceleration](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#car-following_models).
By default they will not accelerate stronger then the *accel* value. The
default model plans its maneuvers so as to stay within the *decel*
value (per second) but other models may interpret this value
differently. All models will never brake harder than the
*emergencyDecel* value (which defaults to the same value as *decel* but
may be set independently).

!!! note
    This is just a convention which the available models obey but which could be ignored by custom models.

## Dawdling

Some car-following models support the `sigma`-attribute which models driver
imperfection. For values above **0**, drivers with the default
car-following model will drive *slower* than would be safe by a random
amount (between \[0, `accel`\]).

# Intersections

Vehicles approaching an intersection without the right-of-way have to
slow down. If the intersection is used by other vehicles which have the
right of way, stopping may be necessary until a safe time-window is
found. That time windows is based on the same safety assumptions as the
car-following model. For the default *Krauss*-model this means that each
vehicle must be able to stop safely even if its lead vehicle brakes
hard to a full stop.

Even if a vehicle has the right-of-way it may need to slow down due to
[impatient](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#impatience)
drivers which drive across the intersection. The [right-of-way rules](../Networks/PlainXML.md#right-of-way)
at an intersection are [defined by the node type-attribute](../Networks/PlainXML.md#node_descriptions)
and by [traffic lights](../Simulation/Traffic_Lights.md).

If a vehicle hasn't yet entered the intersection, it will in most cases slow down in response to any other vehicles that have already entered the intersection unless there is an unobstructed waiting place [within the intersection (an internal junction)](Intersections.md#waiting_within_the_intersection) to which it can move. If two vehicles in conflict are within the intersection at the same time, a priority order is established based on their time of entering, their speed, the right of way rules and the state of any traffic lights. This priority order determines which of the vehicles has to slow down and which one may drive unimpeded.

Per default, a vehicle approaching from a minor road slows down until it
is 4.5m away from the intersection (even if no prioritized vehicle is
nearby). After that it may start to accelerate again if there is a safe
gap in traffic. This distance models the visibility and may be configured for each [individual connection with the 'visibility' attribute](../Networks/PlainXML.md#connection_descriptions).

Vehicles approaching a junction of type 'zipper' automatically determine a vehicle ordering based on their position and speeds.
The may have to slow down in order to follow their determined leader smoothly. By default, zipper merging behavior starts 100m ahead of the junction and this distance may also be configured using the 'visibility' attribute.

Vehicles that pass an intersection may also be subject to [reduced speed limits depending on the turning angle](Intersections.md#speed_while_passing_the_intersection).

# Lane Changing

Vehicles may decide to slow down in order to execute a lane-change
maneuver. They may also slow down in order to aid other vehicles with
lane-changing. If the lane a vehicle is on does not have a connection to
the next edge on a vehicles route, the vehicle will decelerate and stop.

# Stops

Vehicles will decelerate when approaching the position of a
[`stop`-definition](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#stops_and_waypoints).

# Acceleration / Deceleration constraints

Vehicles can only change their speed by a certain amount each time step.
This is defined by the
[`<vType>`-attributes `accel` and `decel`](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#vehicle_types)

# departSpeed / arrivalSpeed

Vehicles enter the network using their [defined `departSpeed`](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#vehicles_and_routes).
When approaching the end of their route they will adapt their speed to
match their [defined `arrivalSpeed`](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#vehicles_and_routes)

# Variable Speed Signs

[Variable speed signs](../Simulation/Variable_Speed_Signs.md) are
used to modify the speed limit of an edge for a defined time interval.

# Calibrators

[Calibrators](../Simulation/Calibrator.md) are used to adapt the
flow on an edge for a defined time interval but may also be used to
modify the speed limit of an edge.

# Devices
[Vehicle devices](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#devices) are a way to customize vehicle behavior or create additional output. The following devices can impact vehicle speed:

- [glosa](../Simulation/GLOSA.md) : slow down and speed up to smooth speed near traffic lights
- [driverstate](../Driver_State.md) : random changes to speed based on modelled perception errors with regard to car-following gap and speed difference

# TraCI

Vehicles can forced to adapt their speed using [TraCI commands](../TraCI/Change_Vehicle_State.md). When using the command
*slow down* stochastic influences on speed are not applied. By using
[the *speed mode* command, various safety related influences can be selectively disabled](../TraCI/Change_Vehicle_State.md#speed_mode_0xb3).
