title: PersonSummary
---

This output contains the simulation-wide number of person that are
loaded, inserted, running, waiting to be inserted, have reached their
destination and how many persons are travelling in which modes.

## Instantiating within the Simulation

You can force the simulation to generate this output using **--person-summary-output** {{DT_FILE}}.

## Generated Output

The information containing all those values is computed for each time
step and the output file looks like following:

```xml
<summary>
    <step time="<SIMULATION_TIME>" \
            loaded="<LOADED_PERSON_NUMBER>" \
            inserted="<INSERTED_PERSON_NUMBER>" \
            walking="<RUNNING_PERSON_NUMBER>" \
            waiting="<NUMBER_OF_PERSONS_WAITING_FOR_INSERTION>" \
            ended="<ENDED_PERSON_NUMBER>" \

    ... further time steps ...

</summary>
```

Please note, that in contrary to the example above, for each time step,
all those values are reported in one line. A description of the values
is given in the table below.
