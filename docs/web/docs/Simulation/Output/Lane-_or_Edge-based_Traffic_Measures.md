title: Lane- or Edge-based Traffic Measures
---

Values within this output describe the situation within the network in
terms of traffic science by giving macroscopic values such as the mean
vehicle speed, the mean density, etc. This output can be generated
either for lanes, edges or groups of edges.

In the following, it is described how both outputs are generated and
which values they contain. Then, the meanings of the values are given as
well as a description of intervals. At last, some additional
possibilities to constrain the outputs are given.

!!! note
    Please remark that these outputs are also called "aggregated lane/edge states", "meandata", or "edge/lane-dumps".

## Instantiating within the Simulation

### Meandata Definition

An edge-based state dump is defined within an {{AdditionalFile}}:

```xml
<additional>
    <edgeData id="<MEASUREMENT_ID>" file="<OUTPUT_FILE>" .../>
</additional>
```

For a lane based dump simply write:

```xml
<additional>
    <laneData id="<MEASUREMENT_ID>" file="<OUTPUT_FILE>" .../>
</additional>
```

The defined file can either be loaded with sumo option **--additional-files FILENAME** or declared in a *.sumocfg* file with `<additional-files value="FILENAME"/>`

!!! note
    attribute 'id' is only used to distinguish outputs if there are multiple edgeData definitions. The value is otherwise arbitrary and does not influence written outputs.


For additional attributes see the table below.

### Simplified definition

If none of the additional attributes listed above are needed, a meandata definition can be declared without defining an additional file by setting one of the following options:

- **--edgedata-output** FILENAME
- **--lanedata-output** FILENAME

The generated definitions will be named *DEFAULT_EDGEDATA* and *DEFAULT_LANEDATA* respectively and will aggregate their values over the whole length of the simulation (edges without traffic will not be included in the output).

## Generated Output

### Edge-Based Network States

For edge-based state dumps, the output file will look like the
following:

```xml
<meandata>
    <interval begin="<INTERVAL_BEGIN>" end="<INTERVAL_END>" id="<MEASUREMENT_ID>">
      <edge id="<EDGE_ID>" sampledSeconds="<COLLECTED_VEHICLE_SECONDS>" \
            traveltime="<MEAN_TRAVEL_TIME>" \
            density="<MEAN_DENSITY>" occupancy="<MEAN_OCCUPANCY>" \
            waitingTime="<TOTAL_WAITING_TIME>" speed="<MEAN_SPEED>" \
            departed="<EMITTED_VEH_NUMBER>" arrived="<ARRIVED_VEH_NUMBER>" \
            entered="<ENTERED_VEH_NUMBER>" left="<LEFT_VEH_NUMBER>" \
            laneChangedFrom="NUMBER_OF_LANE_LEAVERS" laneChangedTO="NUMBER_OF_LANE_ENTERER"/>

      ... more edges ...

    </interval>

    ... further intervals ...

</meandata>
```

Please note, that in contrary to the example above, for each edge, all
values are reported in one line.

### Lane-Based Network States

The generated output looks like the following:

```xml
<meandata>
    <interval begin="<INTERVAL_BEGIN>" end="<INTERVAL_END>" id="<MEASUREMENT_ID>">
      <edge id="<EDGE_ID>">
          <lane id="<LANE_ID>" sampledSeconds="<COLLECTED_VEHICLE_SECONDS>" \
                traveltime="<MEAN_TRAVEL_TIME>" \
                density="<MEAN_DENSITY>" occupancy="<MEAN_OCCUPANCY>" \
                waitingTime="<TOTAL_WAITING_TIME>" speed="<MEAN_SPEED>" \
                departed="<EMITTED_VEH_NUMBER>" arrived="<ARRIVED_VEH_NUMBER>" \
                entered="<ENTERED_VEH_NUMBER>" left="<LEFT_VEH_NUMBER>" \
                laneChangedFrom="<NUMBER_OF_LANE_LEAVERS>" laneChangedTo="<NUMBER_OF_LANE_ENTERER>" \
                speedRelative="<MEAN_SPEED_RELATIVE>" />

          ... more lanes...

      </edge>

      ... more edges ...

    </interval>

    ... further intervals ...

</meandata>
```

Please note, that in contrary to the example above, for each lane, all
values are reported in one line.

### Value Descriptions

Both the edge-dump and the lane-dump are computing the values the same
way: every vehicle move - even those with v=0 - is recorded and saved
during the interval. After the interval has passed, these values are
written into the file after being normalized.

With regard to edgeData `density`, the values are normalized by the number of the
collected vehicle movements and the length of the lane. For `laneDensity` they are also normalized by the
number of lanes of the edge.

The meanings of the written values are given in the following table.

| Name              | Type                 | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| begin             | (simulation) seconds | The first time step the values were collected in     |
| end               | (simulation) seconds | The last time step + DELTA_T in which the reported values were collected     |
| edge\@id           | (edge) id            | The name of the reported edge           |
| lane\@id           | (lane) id            | The name of the reported lane     |
| sampledSeconds    | s                    | The number of vehicles that are present on the edge/lane in each second summed up over the measurement interval (may be subseconds if a vehicle enters/leaves the edge/lane).                                                 |
| traveltime        | s                    | Time needed to pass the edge/lane, note that this is just an estimation based on the mean speed, not the exact time the vehicles needed. The value is based on the time needed for the front of the vehicle to pass the edge. |
| overlapTraveltime | s                    | Time needed to pass the edge/lane completely, note that this is just an estimation based on the mean speed, not the exact time the vehicles needed. The value is based on the time any part of the vehicle was the edge.      |
| density           | \#veh/km             | Vehicle density on the edge    |
| laneDensity           | \#veh/km/lane             | Vehicle density on the edge per lane    |
| occupancy         | %                    | Occupancy of the edge/lane in %. A value of 100 would indicate vehicles standing bumper to bumper on the whole edge (minGap=0).                                                                                               |
| waitingTime       | s                    | The total number of seconds vehicles were considered halting (speed < speedThreshold). Summed up over all vehicles  |
| timeLoss         | s                     | The total number of seconds vehicles lost due to driving slower than desired (summed up over all vehicles)    |
| speed             | m/s                  | The mean speed on the edge/lane within the reported interval.<br><br>**Caution:** This is an average over time and space (space-mean-speed), rather than a local average over the vehicles (time-mean-speed). Since slow vehicles spend more time on the edge they will have a proportionally bigger influence on average speed.     |
| speedRelative     | -                    | quotient of mean speed value (see above) and the lane speed limit |
| departed          | \#veh                | The number of vehicles that have been emitted onto the edge/lane within the described interval    |
| arrived           | \#veh                | The number of vehicles that have finished their route on the edge lane    |
| entered           | \#veh                | The number of vehicles that have entered the edge/lane by moving from upstream      |
| left              | \#veh                | The number of vehicles that have left the edge/lane by moving downstream    |
| laneChangedFrom   | \#veh                | The number of vehicles that changed away from this lane   |
| laneChangedTo     | \#veh                | The number of vehicles that changed to this lane   |
| vaporized         | \#veh                | The number of vehicles vaporized on this edge **(only present if \#veh \> 0)**        |
| teleported        | \#veh                | The number of vehicles teleported from this edge **(only present if \#veh \> 0)**      |

Please note that in the case of *edge* meandata both laneChanged entries
are equal to the total number of lane changes on the edge. Furthermore
each lane change is counted separately, that means if one vehicle
changes from lane 1 to lane 3 it will generate two lane change counts.

## How to aggregate / derive further values

In order to aggregate the output for the same edge / lane over larger
time periods the values which count vehicles have to be simply summed,
density and occupancy can be simply averaged (if the interval lengths
are equal) and speed should be a weighted average with sampledSeconds as
weight. To aggregate the traveltime further, calculate the mean speed
first and then divide edge/lane length by the speed.

Spatial aggregation (over multiple edges or lanes) is not as easy,
especially if they are consecutive, because each vehicle generates data
on each lane it is on, even if it is on multiple lanes. In the case of
many short and fast moving vehicles the error is negligible but if you
have long and slow vehicles you cannot aggregate as above.

The following measurements can be derived from the values given (period
denotes the length of the aggregation interval):

- Average number of vehicles on the edge (\#) = `sampledSeconds /  period`
- Average traffic volume (\#/h) = `speed * 3.6 * density`
- Traffic volume at the begin of the lane / edge (\#/h) = `3600 * entered / period`
- Traffic volume at the end of the lane / edge (\#/h) = `3600 * left /  period`
- Total distance travelled (m) = `speed * sampledSeconds`
- Edge length = `sampledSeconds / period * 1000 / density`


Sometimes one wants to know how many vehicles were on an edge. The exact
definition of this value depends on how departed, arrived and
lane-changing vehicles are counted. Each vehicle is either in *arrived*,
*left* or *laneChangedFrom* and each vehicle is also either in
*departed*, *entered* or *laneChangedTo*. However, a vehicle may be
counted multiple times in *laneChangedFrom* and *laneChangedTo* if it
performed back-and-forth lane changing.

The following `<edgeData>` values are all reasonable counts in that they count each
vehicle only once but they include/exclude some special cases.

- entered
- entered + departed
- left
- left + arrived

!!! note
    When using `<laneData>` the sum *left* + *arrived* excludes all the vehicles that exited the lane by lane-changing. whereas the sum *left* + *arrived* + *laneChangedFrom* may count vehicles multiple times. If total counts on a lane are needed it is better to use a [detector](../../Simulation/Output/index.md#simulated_detectors).

## Notes

- Per default, all edges are written, even those on which no vehicle
  drove. If the lane / edge collected no data the attributes speed,
  traveltime, density, occupancy and waitingTime are not written. One
  can disable writing unused edges/lanes by setting the
  `excludeEmpty` attribute to true.
- Even on lanes/edges which have sampledSeconds="0.00" since the real
  number of sampledSeconds may be 0.001 and was cut off in the output.
  To define a minimum number of samples before you consider your data
  valid, use `minSamples` in the meandata
  definition.
- Even though no data was collected (sampledSeconds="0") departed and
  laneChangedTo may be different from 0 because internally lane
  changes and departures happen at the end of a time step.
- The interval end is the interval begin + aggregation time, meaning
  that values were collected within these steps excluding the end time
  itself. If the simulation ends before the last interval is over, the
  interval will be pruned.
- The output file will be generated, does not have to exist earlier
  and will be overwritten if existing without any warning. The folder
  the output file shall be generated in must exist.
- If you need only information about the network states during certain
  time periods, you may constraint generation of the dumps by creating
  multiple dumps with the attributes
  `begin=""` and
  `end=""`. All of them may have
  identical ids and write to the same output file.
