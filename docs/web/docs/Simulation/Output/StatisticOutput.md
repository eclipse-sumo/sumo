title: Statistic Output
---

# Instantiating within the Simulation

Statistic output is activated by setting the simulation option **--statistic-output** {{DT_FILE}} on the command line or in a *.sumocfg* file.

!!! note
    The elements `vehicleTripStatistics`, `pedestrianStatistics`, `rideStatistics` and `transportStatistics` are only generated when either of the options **--duration-log.statistics** or **--tripinfo-output** are set.

# Generated Output

The generated XML file looks like this:

```xml
<statistics>
    <performance ''ATTRIBUTES''.../>
    <vehicles ''ATTRIBUTES''.../>
    <teleports ''ATTRIBUTES''.../>
    <safety ''ATTRIBUTES''.../>
    <persons ''ATTRIBUTES''.../>
    <personTeleports ''ATTRIBUTES''.../>
    <vehicleTripStatistics ''ATTRIBUTES''.../>
    <pedestrianStatistics ''ATTRIBUTES''.../>
    <rideStatistics ''ATTRIBUTES''.../>
    <transportStatistics ''ATTRIBUTES''.../>
</statistics>
```

The following output attributes are generated:

# Usage examples

## Fair Traveltime comparison between simulations
When comparing simulations with a fixed end-time, those simulations may differ in the number of departed and arrived vehicles. In this case, care must be taken to include the "missing" vehicles in a comparison, since many outputs only include arrived vehicles by default.
To include statistics for these vehicles, the options **--tripinfo-output.write-unfinished --duration-log.statistics** must be set.
The general idea is to add up the travel time (duration) and the time that was spent waiting for departure (departDelay) for all vehicles that were defined in the input.

To simplify comparison between simulations that have the same number of vehicles, the attributes 'totalTravelTime' and 'totalDepartDelay' are provided.

An alternative way to compute the sum of travel time and delays is to multiply the averages:

```
totalTravelTimeAndDelay =
     vehicles.inserted * (vehicleTripStatistics.duration + vehicleTripStatistics.departDelay)
   + vehicles.waiting * vehicleTripStatistics.departDelayWaiting
```
