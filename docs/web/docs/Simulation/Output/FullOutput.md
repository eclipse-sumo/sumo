title: FullOutput
---

The idea behind this option is to improve the capabilities of the
existing netstate-dump option. The produced XML Structure contains
information about the edges, lanes, vehicles and traffic lights. The
intention for this option was to check the simulation results without
having to record all the simulation commands e.g. traci.

## Instantiating within the Simulation

To force SUMO to build a file that contains the full dump, extend your
command line parameter by **--full-output** {{DT_FILE}}. {{DT_FILE}} is the name of the file the output will be
written to. Any other file with this name will be overwritten, the
destination folder must exist.

## Generated Output

The full dump is a xml-file containing informtation about every edge,
lane, vehicle and traffic light for each time step. A full dump-file
looks like this:

```xml
<full-export>
    <data timestep="<TIME_STEP>">

    <vehicles>
        <vehicle id="<VEHICLE_ID>" eclass="<VEHICLE_ECLASS>" co2="<VEHICLE_CO2>" co="<VEHICLE_CO>" hc="<VEHICLE_HC>"

        </edge>

            ... more edges of the network

    </edges>

    <tls>

        ... more traffic lights

    </tls>

</data>

## Notes

The generated files will be very large, you may pipe this output
directly to a compression tool like bzip2. The advantage of this large
file is that you can write some nice XML Stylesheets to export
everything what is important to you, for example the states of the
traffic lights and the travel times for the lanes.
