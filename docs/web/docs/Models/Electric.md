# Overview

Since version 0.24.0 SUMO includes a model for electric vehicles. It was
implemented by Tamás Kurczveil and Pablo Álvarez López from the
[TU-Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/). The core of the
model is implemented in the [vehicle
device](../Developer/How_To/Device.md) *device.battery*. Additional
features are a charging station (which can be placed on any lane in the
network) and a new output option **--battery-output** {{DT_FILE}}.

You can find a test case for these implementations at
[\[1\]](https://github.com/eclipse-sumo/sumo/tree/main/tests/sumo/devices/battery/braunschweig)

# Defining Electric Vehicles

Different aspects of electric vehicles are modeled separately. This page puts the focus
on modeling the battery and how it is charged and discharged. The actual energy consumption values themselves
are part of the emission modelling because SUMO can use different models for that.

To track the charging status of a vehicle, it must be equipped with a battery
device. This may be done using the option **--device.battery.explicit <vehID1,vehID2,...\>** or simply setting **--device.battery.probability 1** to equip
all vehicles. Alternatively, the device may be specified using [Generic
vehicle parameters](../Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#devices).

Additional properties of the vehicle and its electrical components must
then be defined via [parameters of the vehicle or its
type](../Simulation/GenericParameters.md). Some property can only be defined for the vehicle type.

These values have the following meanings (the defaults are from the Kia below):

| key                               | Value Type | Default           | Description                                             |

| loading                           | float      | 0 (kg)            | Additional mass **(to be defined in the vehicle type)**     |

| recuperationEfficiency            | float      | 0.96              | Recuperation efficiency *η<sub>recup</sub>*             |
| stoppingThreshold                 | float      | 0.1 (m/s)         | Maximum velocity to start charging                      |
| device.battery.maximumChargeRate  | float      | 150000 (W)        | Maximum charging rate of the battery                    |
| device.battery.chargeLevelTable   | float list |                   | Ordered list of state of charge values (from 0 to 1) for which maximum charge rates are defined in `device.battery.chargeCurveTable` |
| device.battery.chargeCurveTable   | float list |                   | Corresponding maximum charge rates to each state of charge value in `device.battery.chargeLevelTable` |

!!! note
    Before SUMO 1.20.0 the `rotatingMass` was called `internalMomentOfInertia` but it has been renamed to make clear
    that it is a mass and not a moment of inertia. The old parameter is considered deprecated.
    Also the `vehicleMass` has been deprecated in favor of the new `mass` attribute of vehicles / vehicle types.

An example of a vehicle with electric attribute (those are the values for a city bus from the original publication):

```xml
<routes>
    <vType id="ElectricBus" accel="1.0" decel="1.0" length="12" maxSpeed="100.0" sigma="0.0" minGap="2.5" mass="10000" color="1,1,1">
        <param key="has.battery.device" value="true"/>
        <param key="device.battery.capacity" value="2000"/>
        <param key="maximumPower" value="1000"/>
        <param key="frontSurfaceArea" value="5"/>
        <param key="airDragCoefficient" value="0.6"/>
        <param key="rotatingMass" value="100"/>
        <param key="radialDragCoefficient" value="0.5"/>
        <param key="rollDragCoefficient" value="0.01"/>
        <param key="constantPowerIntake" value="100"/>
        <param key="propulsionEfficiency" value="0.9"/>
        <param key="recuperationEfficiency" value="0.9"/>
        <param key="stoppingThreshold" value="0.1"/>
        <param key="device.battery.maximumChargeRate" value="150000"/>
    </vType>
</routes>
```

If a vehicle has a battery device (and is not [tracking fuel](#tracking_fuel_consumption_for_non-electrical_vehicles))
and no explicit `emissionClass` is defined, it will be assigned the emission class `Energy/unknown`.
It will not use the [default emission class](../Vehicle_Type_Parameter_Defaults.md) derived from the vehicle class then.
This is for backward compatibility and will issue a warning because in general it is preferable to set the emission class explicitly.
Most of the parameters above do actually apply to this emission class and not to the battery device itself.

The initial energy content of the battery (by default `0.5*device.battery.capacity`) can
be set in the vehicle definitions

```xml
<routes>
    <vehicle id="0" type="type1" depart="0" color="1,0,0">
        <param key="device.battery.chargeLevel" value="500"/>
    </vehicle>
</routes>
```

The charging rate of the battery at a charging station is limited to model the effects of battery management controllers (e.g. charge a nearly full battery less than an nearly empty one).
There are two ways to define the maximum charge rate: For a constant rate set the attribute `device.battery.maximumChargeRate`.
If instead a maximum charge rate depending on the state of charge is wanted, it can be defined through data points between which the rate will get interpolated.
The states of charge have to be given in `device.battery.chargeLevelTable` and the corresponding charge rates in `device.battery.chargeCurveTable`.
If defined, the maximum charge curve takes precedence over the constant maximum charge rate `device.battery.maximumChargeRate`. An example definition where the charge rate decreases above
50% state of charge looks like the following:

```xml
<routes>
    <vehicle id="0" type="type1" depart="0" color="1,0,0">
        <param key="device.battery.chargeLevelTable" value="0 0.5 1"/>
        <param key="device.battery.chargeCurveTable" value="45000 45000 20000"/>
    </vehicle>
</routes>
```

# Vehicle behavior

By default, vehicle behavior will not be affected by battery level. Car will keep driving even when their battery capacity is at 0. To avoid this, either [TraCI](#traci) must be used to change speed or route based on the current battery level or
the [stationfinder device](../Simulation/Stationfinder.md) can be configured to monitor the battery capacity.

# Charging Stations

A charging station is a surface defined on a lane in which the vehicles
equipped with a battery are charged. The basic structure and parameters
of bus stops were used for the implementation of charging stations.

| key                 | Value Type | Value range                                                                                | Default   | Description         |

| **chargeInTransit** | bool       | true or false                                                                              | false  | Enable or disable charge in transit, i.e. vehicle is forced/not forced to stop for charging                                     |

Charging stations are defined in additional using the following format:

```xml
<additional>
    <chargingStation chargeDelay="2" chargeInTransit="0" power="200000" efficiency="0.95" endPos="25" id="cS_2to19_0a" lane="2to19_0" startPos="10"/>
</additional>
```

And are represented in the simulation as shown:

![](../images/ChargingStation.png "Representation of chargingStation in GUI")
Representation of chargingStation in GUI

![](../images/ChargingStationCharging.png "Color of chargingStation during charge")
Color of chargingStation during charge

## Stopping at a Charging Station

A stop at a charging station may occur due to traffic conditions,
stopping at a defined location or stopping at an explicit
chargingStation as defined below:

```xml
<routes>
    <vehicle id="v0" route="route0" depart="0">
        <stop chargingStation="myChargingStationID" until="50"/>
    </vehicle>
</routes>
```

## Charging Station output

There are two variants of the charging station output. One lists values for all time steps whereas the other
aggregates the data into charging events (thus related to the whole time a vehicle was connected to the charging station).

### Full report

Option **--chargingstations-output chargingstations.xml** generates a full
report of energy charged by charging stations:

</output>
```

# battery-output

There are three output parameters to be set in the SUMO configuration to
use the battery device:

```xml
<configuration>
    <input>
        <net-file value="netFile.xml"/>
        <route-files value="routeFile.xml"/>
        <additional-files value="additionalFile.xml"/>
    </input>
    <output>
        <battery-output value="Battery.out.xml"/>
        <battery-output.precision value="4"/>
        <device.battery.probability value="1"/>
        <summary-output value="summary_100.xml"/>
    </output>
</configuration>
```

The battery-output generates a file with this structure:

```xml

# Emission Output

The [Emission model](../Models/Emissions.md#outputs)-outputs of
SUMO can be used together with the battery device when setting the
`<vType>`-parameter `emissionClass="Energy/unknown"`.

# Tracking fuel consumption for non-electrical vehicles

By setting option **--device.battery.track-fuel**, equipped vehicles with a conventional drive train (emissionClass other than `Energy`) will monitor their fuel level based on the fuel consumption of their respective emission class. All capacity values are then interpreted as mg instead of Wh. Also, the chargingStation power is re-interpreted as mg/s when charging fuel.

# TraCI

The internal state of the battery device can be accessed directly using
[*traci.vehicle.getParameter*](../TraCI/Vehicle_Value_Retrieval.md#supported_device_parameters)
and
[*traci.vehicle.setParameter*](../TraCI/Change_Vehicle_State.md#supported_device_parameters).
Charging stations can be inspected and updated using the respective getter and setter functions inside [*traci.chargingstation*](../TraCI/ChargingStation.md).

Furthermore, the function
[*traci.vehicle.getElectricityConsumption()*](../TraCI/Vehicle_Value_Retrieval.md#command_0xa4_get_vehicle_variable)
can be used to access the consumption of the vehicle if the `emissionClass="Energy/unknown"` [is
declared](#emission_output).

## Query of the current state of charge

The current state of charge of the battery can be computed as the quotient of the actual battery charge and the maximum battery capacity:
```python
capacity = float(traci.vehicle.getParameter(vehID, "device.battery.capacity"))
currentCharge = float(traci.vehicle.getParameter(vehID, "device.battery.chargeLevel"))
stateOfCharge = currentCharge / capacity
```

## Calculating the remaining Range

After the vehicle has been driving for a while, the remaining range can be computed based on previous consumption and distance:
```python
mWh = traci.vehicle.getDistance(vehID) / float(traci.vehicle.getParameter(vehID, "device.battery.totalEnergyConsumed"))
remainingRange = float(traci.vehicle.getParameter(vehID, "device.battery.chargeLevel")) * mWh
```
To compute the remaining range on departure, the value of `mWh` (meters per Watt-hour) should be calibrated from a prior simulation.

## Reducing the power of a charging station

If too many consumers connect to the eletrical grid, it may not be able to supply the nominal power of the charging station. A temporary
power drop of 20% can be modeled using the following sample code:
```python
prevPower = traci.chargingstation.getPower(chargingStationID) # remember for restoring the full power later
traci.chargingstation.setPower(chargingStationID, prevPower * 0.8)
```

# Model Details

All information about the implemented device (including details on the
vehicle energy consumption and charging model) can be found in the

Observations:
- Simulation efficiencies of 6.3 - 6.7 km driven per kWh consumed agree with measured efficiencies of 6.4 - 6.8 (stddev 0.4 - 0.8) in short and medium range simulations with realistic traffic
- abstract scenarios without junctions and other cars overestimate the efficiency by a large factor (~ twice as many km/kWh)
