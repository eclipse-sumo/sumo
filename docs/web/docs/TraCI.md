## Introduction to TraCI

TraCI is the short term for "**Tra**ffic **C**ontrol **I**nterface".
Giving access to a running road traffic simulation, it allows to
retrieve values of simulated objects and to manipulate their behavior
"on-line". If performance is an issue you should consider using
[libsumo](Libsumo.md) instead. You can also start with TraCI and switch
to libsumo later, since the function signatures are the same.

## Using TraCI

### SUMO startup

TraCI uses a TCP based client/server architecture to provide access to
[sumo](sumo.md). Thereby, [sumo](sumo.md) acts as server
that is started with additional command-line options: **--remote-port** {{DT_INT}} where {{DT_INT}} is the
port [sumo](sumo.md) will listen on for incoming connections.

When started with the **--remote-port** {{DT_INT}} option, [sumo](sumo.md) only prepares the
simulation and waits for all external applications to connect and take
over the control. Please note, that the **--end** {{DT_TIME}} option is ignored when
[sumo](sumo.md) runs as a TraCI server, [sumo](sumo.md)
runs until the client demands a simulation end.

When using [sumo-gui](sumo-gui.md) as a server, the simulation
must either be started by using the [*play*
button](sumo-gui.md#usage_description) or by setting the option **--start**
before TraCI commands will be processed.

### Multiple clients

The number of clients which can connect can be given as an additional
option **--num-clients** {{DT_INT}}, where 1 is the default. Please note that in multi client
scenarios you must explicitly specify the execution order of the clients
using the
[*SetOrder*-command](TraCI/Control-related_commands.md#command_0x03_setorder).

Each client must specify a unique (but otherwise arbitrary) integer value
and the client commands will be handled in the order from the lowest to
the highest value within each simulation step.

The clients are automatically synchronized after every simulation step. This means, the simulation does not advance to the next step until all clients have called the 'simulationStep'' command. Also, the simulationStep command only returns control to the client after the simulation has advanced.

!!! caution
    The simulation will only start once all clients have connected.

### Protocol specification

Please see the [TraCI Protocol Specification](TraCI/Protocol.md)
(including [Basic Flow](TraCI/Protocol.md#basic_flow),
[Messages](TraCI/Protocol.md#messages), [Data
Types](TraCI/Protocol.md#data_types)).

### Shutdown

When using TraCI, the **--end** option of [sumo](sumo.md) is ignored.
Instead the simulation is closed by issuing the [*close*
command](TraCI/Control-related_commands.md#command_0x7f_close).
To detect whether all route files have been exhausted and all vehicles
have left the simulation, one can check whether the command
[getMinExpectedNumber](TraCI/Simulation_Value_Retrieval.md)
returns 0. The simulation will end as soon as all clients have sent the
*close* command.

It is also possible to reload the simulation with a new list of
arguments by using the
[*load*-command](TraCI/Control-related_commands.md#command_0x01_load).

## TraCI Commands

- [Control-related commands](TraCI/Control-related_commands.md): perform a
  simulation step, close the connection, reload the simulation.
- [Generic Parameters](TraCI/GenericParameters.md)

For the following APIs, the ID is equal to the ID defined in
[sumo](sumo.md)'s input files. Here, you find their [general
structure](TraCI/SUMO_ID_Commands_Structure.md).

## Using SUMO as a library

Normally, TraCI is used to couple multiple processes: A SUMO server
process and one or more TraCI client processes. Alternatively,
[Libsumo](Libsumo.md) can be used to embed SUMO as a library
into the client process. This allows using the same method signatures as
in the client libraries but avoids the overhead of socket communication.
Libsumo supports generating client libraries using
[SWIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIG) and can therefore be used
with a large number of programming languages. C++, Java and Python
bindings are included when downloading a sumo-build.

## Example use

- There is a [tutorial on using TraCI for adaptive traffic
  lights](Tutorials/TraCI4Traffic_Lights.md) (using Python).
- The [Tutorials/CityMobil](Tutorials/CityMobil.md) tutorial
  uses TraCI for assigning new routes to vehicles (using Python).
- The
  [Tutorials/TraCIPedCrossing](Tutorials/TraCIPedCrossing.md)
  tutorial uses TraCI for building a crossing with a pedestrian
  triggered traffic light.

## Resources

### Interfaces by Programming Language

- Python: [the python module traci](TraCI/Interfacing_TraCI_from_Python.md) allows
  to interact with [sumo](sumo.md) using Python (This library
  is part of the sumo source code and all releases, is tested daily and supports all TraCI commands).
  It is also [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/traci/) and can thus be installed
  using `pip install traci`.
- C++: [libtraci](Libtraci.md) is a client library that is part of the [sumo](sumo.md)-source tree. It is fully API-compatible with [libsumo](Libsumo.md).
- C++: [The C++ TraCIAPI](TraCI/C++TraCIAPI.md) is a client
  library that is part of the [sumo](sumo.md)-source tree. (API
  coverage is good but this client is no longer updated. Please use libtraci instead.)
- C++: [The Veins project](https://veins.car2x.org) provides a
  middle-ware for coupling [sumo](sumo.md) with
  [OMNET++](https://omnetpp.org/). As part of the infrastructure it
  provides a C++ client library for the TraCI API (API completeness is
  a bit behind the python client).
- .NET:
  [TraCI.NET](https://github.com/CodingConnected/CodingConnected.Traci)
  is a client library with good API coverage.
- .NET: libtracics is an experimental SWIG generated binding to the original libtraci.
  It has full API coverage but is untested and needs to be generated by the user from the source.
- Matlab
  [TraCI4Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44805-traci4matlab).
  The client is included as part of each SUMO release in
  {{SUMO}}*/tools/contributed/traci4matlab*
  Not all TraCI commands have been implemented. It is recommended to
  [use the python client](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-python-libraries.html) from inside Matlab instead.
- Java: [libtraci](Libtraci.md) is a client library that is part of the [sumo](sumo.md)-source tree.
  It is fully API-compatible with [libsumo](Libsumo.md) and a SUMO release provides pro-compiled Java bindings (via SWIG).
- Java: [TraaS](TraCI/TraaS.md#java_client) provides a client
  library that is part of the [sumo](sumo.md)-source tree (API
  coverage is large but this client is no longer updated. Use libtraci instead)
- Others: Any language that is supported by [SWIG](https://swig.org/) can in principle use the bindings provided by libsumo or libtraci.

### V2X simulation

TraCI allows to use [sumo](sumo.md) in combination with
communication network simulators for simulating [vehicular
communication](Topics/V2X.md). See
[Topics/V2X](Topics/V2X.md) for a list of available solutions.

### Other Resources

- [sumo](sumo.md)'s TraCI Server is a part of the plain
  distribution. The source code is located in the folder
  `src/traci-server`.

## Performance

Using TraCI slows down the simulation speed. The amount of slow-down
depends on many factors:

- number of TraCI function calls per simulation step
- types of TraCI functions being called (some being more expensive
  than others)
- computation within the TraCI script
- client language

!!! note
    Please always consider using [libsumo](Libsumo.md) if performance is important.
    While it is much faster in general, not all optimizations mentioned below are applicable to libsumo as well.
    Especially subscriptions might even turn out to be slower.

### Examples

As an example use-case consider retrieving the x,y position of each
vehicle during every simulation step (using the python client):

```py
while traci.simulation.getMinExpectedNumber() > 0:
    for veh_id in traci.vehicle.getIDList():
         position = traci.vehicle.getPosition(veh_id)
    traci.simulationStep()
```

- This script is able to process about 25000 vehicles per second.
- The same value retrieval can also be sped up to 50000 vehicles per
  second by using
  [subscriptions](TraCI/Object_Variable_Subscription.md):

```py
while traci.simulation.getMinExpectedNumber() > 0:
    for veh_id in traci.simulation.getDepartedIDList():
        traci.vehicle.subscribe(veh_id, [traci.constants.VAR_POSITION])
    positions = traci.vehicle.getAllSubscriptionResults()
    traci.simulationStep()
```

When using this script on the [Bologna
scenario](Data/Scenarios.md#bologna) (9000 vehicles, 5000
simulation steps) the following running times were recorded:

- without TraCI 8s
- plain position retrieval 90s
- retrieval using subscriptions 42s

The C++ client performance is higher:

- plain position retrieval 80s
- retrieval using subscriptions 28s

## Current and Future Development

Historically TraCI used a different (single byte) command ID for every
domain (induction loops, vehicle etc.) where the more significant half
of the byte denotes the command (get, set, subscribe, ...) and the
lesser significant the domain itself. To allow more than the 16 domains
resulting from this split, the most significant bit (which was unused
until version 1.7.0 because there were only 7 commands) is now used for the domain
as well (and only three for the command). This allows for 28 domains
because four general commands (like SIMSTEP) block some available combinations.
Currently there are only four possible domains left.

Furthermore after the invention of libsumo
some parts of the TraCI interface are so generic that it may be not so
hard to invent a wrapper with Apache Kafka or Google protocol buffers
which could in the long run replace the need for all the byte fiddling
and the different hand crafted clients.

## Troubleshooting

### Output files are not closed.

This problem occurs if the client tries to access the output while
the simulation is still closing down. This can be solved by letting
the client wait for the simulation to shut down. The bug report was #524

### Obsolete APIs

There used to be two "generations" of [TraCI](TraCI.md)
commands. The first one mainly uses an internal mapping between the
string-typed IDs used in [sumo](sumo.md) and an external
representation of these which is int-based. The mapping was done
internally (within [TraCI](TraCI.md)).
The second "generation", the current one uses string-IDs equal to
those [sumo](sumo.md) reads. If you are bound to the first
generation API (for instance if you want to use TraNS) you can only
use [sumo](sumo.md) up to version 0.12.3. See
[FAQ](FAQ.md) about obtaining an old version.
