# Introduction

The [Fundamental diagram of traffic
flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_diagram_of_traffic_flow)
describes the relationship between flow (vehicles per hour) and density
(vehicles per km).

Both measures can be obtained from
[edgeData-output](../Simulation/Output/Lane-_or_Edge-based_Traffic_Measures.md).
The *density* value measures vehicles per km and the flow can be
computed from *entered* \* 3600 / *period* where *period* is the specified
aggregation interval of the output.

Generally, this can be computed for any kind of scenario as long as this
scenario covers the desired range of traffic densities.

Plots may be created with [plotXMLAttributes](../Tools/Visualization.md#fundamental_diagram_from_edgedata).

# Fundamental diagram of a closed circular route

A common scenario that is used to generate the fundamental diagram is a
circular route where the density is increased over time. Such a scenario
can be found at [{{SUMO}}/tests/sumo/cf_model/drive_in_circles]({{Source}}tests/sumo/cf_model/drive_in_circles).

There are different ways for increasing the density. The key problem
that must be solved is that density can only be increased when there is
sufficient space to insert additional vehicles. In a closed system, all
the space is eventually taken up by the existing vehicles and the safety
gaps between them. Additional space can only be obtained by lowering the
speed in some parts of the circle to reduce these gaps.
A special case are scenarios that feature spontaneous break down of speed and a traveling jam wave which permits different local densities over time.

## Reducing the speed evenly

An elegant way to reduce the speed is to initialize the network with
evenly spaced vehicles at a predefined density. For the circle scenario
this can be accomplished by the following demand definition:

```xml
<route id="circle" edges="6/1to7/1 7/1to8/1 8/1to9/1 9/1to10/1 10/1to1/1 1/1to2/1 2/1to3/1 3/1to4/1 4/1to5/1 5/1to6/1"/>
<flow id="0" type="default" route="circle" departEdge="random" begin="0" end="1" number="1000" departPos="last" departSpeed="15" departLane="free"/>
```

The disadvantage of this approach is the need to run the simulation multiple times with different values of
**departSpeed** to achieve different densities.

## Reducing the speed locally

An alternative approach is to reduce the speed at some part of the
circle repeatedly and insert vehicles downstream of the speed reduction
where the local density is reduced for a time. This can be accomplished
with the following definition (to be placed in an {{AdditionalFile}})

```xml
<variableSpeedSign id="disturbance" lanes="10/1to1/1_0">
    <step time="2000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="2100"/>
    <step time="3000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="3100"/>
    <step time="4000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="4100"/>
    <step time="5000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="5200"/>
    <step time="6000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="6200"/>
    <step time="7000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="7200"/>
    <step time="8000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="8300"/>
    <step time="9000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="9300"/>
    <step time="10000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="10300"/>
    <step time="11000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="11400"/>
    <step time="12000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="12400"/>
    <step time="13000" speed="1"/>
    <step time="13400"/>
</variableSpeedSign>
```

!!! caution
    This speed reduction will introduce some small artifacts into the resulting fundamental diagram.

And a flow that continuously tries to add vehicles:

```xml
<flow id="0" type="default" begin="0" end="60000" period="3" departPos="last" departSpeed="max" departLane="free">
  <route edges="1/1to2/1 2/1to3/1 3/1to4/1 4/1to5/1 5/1to6/1"/>
</flow>
```

## Reducing the speed spontaneously

Some car-following models permit spontaneous break-down of flow given the right configuration parameters, density or lane changing situation.
For the default Krauss carFollowModel, it is sufficient to set sigma ~ 0.8 to observe stochastic break-down at densities of ~ 50 veh/km and given sigma = 1 the break-down may also occur at 30 veh/km.

## Reducing the speed spontaneously
It's possible to observe spontaneous breakdown given the sufficient length of road, and the right configuration of  parameters, density and lane changing situations.

!!! note
    Theses tests set a low value of **--end** to save time. To get a fuller fundamental diagram, increase the end time.
