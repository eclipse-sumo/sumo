Warning: Missing yellow phase in tlLogic 'C', program 'bad' for tl-index 8 when switching to phase 1.
Warning: Program 'bad' at tlLogic 'C' is incompatible with logic at junction 'C' (mutual conflict between link indices 3,8 tl indices 3,8 phase 0).
  To avoid deadlock/collisions, either: rebuild the signal plan with a newer version of netconvert/netedit
  or rebuild the network with option '--tls.ignore-internal-junction-jam' or include the program when building.
