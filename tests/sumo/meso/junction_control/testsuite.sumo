# tests a problematic network:
# - the network contains a roundabout. This may lead to dead-lock if junction control is switched off
# - the network contains a faulty traffic light. This leads to bad flow if junction control is switched on

# the basic cross net with tls off, multique and junction control. 
# This should run longer than test 'no_tls' because without multique the combined capacity of 2 lanes can be used for going straight or turning.
