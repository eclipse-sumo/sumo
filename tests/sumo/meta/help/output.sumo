  --meso-taujf TIME                    Factor for calculating the jam-free
                                        headway time
  --meso-taujj TIME                    Factor for calculating the jam-jam

                                        consider a segment jammed. A negative
                                        argument causes thresholds to be
                                        computed based on edge speed and tauff
                                        (default)

                                        lights from hindering flow in

                                        actual phases
  --meso-tls-flow-penalty FLOAT        Apply scaled headway penalties when
                                        driving across tls controlled junctions
                                        based on green split instead of checking
                                        actual phases
  --meso-minor-penalty TIME            Apply fixed time penalty when driving
                                        across a minor link. When using
                                        --meso-junction-control.limited, the
                                        penalty is not applied whenever limited
                                        control is active.
  --meso-overtaking                    Enable mesoscopic overtaking
  --meso-recheck TIME                  Time interval for rechecking insertion
                                        into the next segment after failure
