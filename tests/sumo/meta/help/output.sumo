                                        priority junction handling
  --meso-junction-control.limited      Enable mesoscopic traffic light and
                                        priority junction handling for saturated
                                        links. This prevents faulty traffic
                                        lights from hindering flow in
                                        low-traffic situations
  --meso-tls-penalty FLOAT             Apply scaled travel time penalties when
                                        driving across tls controlled junctions
                                        based on green split instead of checking
                                        actual phases
  --meso-tls-flow-penalty FLOAT        Apply scaled headway penalties when
                                        driving across tls controlled junctions
                                        based on green split instead of checking
                                        actual phases
  --meso-minor-penalty TIME            Apply fixed time penalty when driving
                                        across a minor link. When using
                                        --meso-junction-control.limited, the
                                        penalty is not applied whenever limited
                                        control is active.
  --meso-overtaking                    Enable mesoscopic overtaking
  --meso-recheck TIME                  Time interval for rechecking insertion
                                        into the next segment after failure
