Warning: Value of tau=0.50 in vehicle type 'leader' lower than simulation step size may cause collisions.
Warning: Value of tau=0.50 in vehicle type 'follower' lower than simulation step size may cause collisions.
Warning: Vehicle 'follower' performs emergency braking on lane 'middle_0' with decel=9.00, wished=4.50, severity=1.00, time=41.00.
Warning: Teleporting vehicle 'follower'; collision with vehicle 'leader', lane='middle_0', gap=-0.46, time=45.00, stage=move.
Warning: Vehicle 'follower' teleports beyond arrival edge 'middle', time=45.00.
