# - Observing breakdown requires a long road because the disturbance travels upstream and needs some time to develop
# - Krauss sigma may create a critical disturbance but also reduces density (which absorbs disturbances)
# - To increase the likelyhood of breakdown, density must be increased further (tau 0.9)
# - Simulation is free of "physical" collisions but we have to disable collision warnings for mingap violations
# - we need large disturbances to reach standstill from a high speed of ~36 (sigma=1)

# - To increase the likelyhood of breakdown, density must be increased further (tau 0.9)

# - observing breakdown for vehicles requires shorter edges because more vehicles fit on the same amount of road and averaging smoothes out the disturbances
# - dawdling for Krauss is scaled to accel so the effect is reduced for bicycles
# - setting startupDelay between 1 and 2 can be used to scale the amount of breakdown

# instead of creating a disturbance with high sigma, we combine long plattoons of fast vehicles (on the left lane) with occasional slow vehicles (on the right lane) to occasionally obstruct the plattoon via lane changing
