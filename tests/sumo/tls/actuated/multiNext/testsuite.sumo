# request arms have a permissive left turn that gets stalled out

# request arms have a permissive left turn that gets stalled out,
# the stalled arm has robust detection due to increased detector length

# This test checks that the dynamic phase skipping feature works correctly relatively to detected traffic on a bicycle lane.
