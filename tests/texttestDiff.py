"""
This is meant to be used as a diff tool for the sumo public and internal tests by adding the line
----------------------------
diff_program:texttestDiff.py
----------------------------
in ~/.texttest/config

It runs the textual diff tool (vim by default) and, if the differing files are
sumo networks, opens both of them with sumo-gui.
