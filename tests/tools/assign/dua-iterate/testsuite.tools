# test solutions for the braess paradox (adding a shortcut makes the traveltimes worse).
# After 7 iterations the assignments have mostly converged (average traveltime 107 vs 127). Without the shortcut avg. tt converges to 106s and with shortcut to 123s.
# Iteration 10 has the minimal value of 114s for shortcut.
