# Contributing to Eclipse SUMO

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Eclipse Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) is a free and open traffic
simulation toolsuite. SUMO allows modelling and analyzing intermodal traffic
systems, including road vehicles, public transport, cargo logistics and
pedestrians. Included with SUMO is a wealth of supporting tools, which handle
tasks like route finding, visualization, network import and emission
calculation. SUMO can be enhanced with custom models and it provides various
APIs to remotely control and influence the simulation.

## Developer resources

Information regarding source code management, builds, coding standards, and
more.

* https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Developer/Main.html

The project maintains the following source code repositories

* https://github.com/eclipse-sumo/sumo
* https://github.com/eclipse-sumo/sumo.website
* https://github.com/dlr-ts/homebrew-sumo

We are happily reviewing pull requests against the master of this repository.
For details see below and https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/FAQ.html#how_do_code_contributions_work.

In order to allow the development of separate external modules for SUMO (which are not
part of the mainline repository) every source code directory lists the files and
subdirectories where modifications need to be made available under the EPL and in a
separate list which files / directories are considered interfaces to external modules,
as an entry point see the [contribution README in the src dir](src/README_Contributing.md).
