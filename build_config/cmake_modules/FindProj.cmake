# CMake module to search for Proj library
#
# If it's found it sets PROJ_FOUND to TRUE
# and following variables are set:
#    PROJ_INCLUDE_DIR
#    PROJ_API_FILE
#    PROJ_LIBRARY

# FIND_PATH and FIND_LIBRARY normally search standard locations
# before the specified paths. To search non-standard paths first,
# FIND_* is invoked first with specified paths and NO_DEFAULT_PATH
# and then again with no specified paths to search the default
# locations. When an earlier FIND_* succeeds, subsequent FIND_*s
# searching for the same item do nothing.

# try to use framework on mac
# want clean framework path, not unix compatibility path
