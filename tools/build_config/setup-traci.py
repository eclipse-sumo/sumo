    long_description='''# TraCI - Traffic Control Interface

TraCI (short for Traffic Control Interface) is an API that provides access to a SUMO traffic simulation,
enabling controlling the behavior of multiple simulation objects during a live simulation.
It allows for external scripts to interact with the simulation and its vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure.

## Installation

To use TraCI, you must first have an Eclipse SUMO installation. Install TraCI by simply executing:
```pip install traci```

A [daily version](https://test.pypi.org/project/traci/) is also available in TestPyPI:
```pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ traci```

## Getting Started

To use TraCI in your Python code, import the `traci` module. The following code snippet shows a basic example
of how to connect to a running SUMO simulation using TraCI:

```python
import traci

# Connect to SUMO simulation
traci.start(["sumo", "-c", "path/to/your/sumocfg/file.sumocfg"])

# Simulation loop
step = 0
while step < 1000:
    traci.simulationStep()
    # Your simulation logic here
    step += 1

# Close TraCI connection
traci.close()
```

Once connected to the SUMO simulation, TraCI provides a range of functions that can be used to query and modify
the state of the simulation. For example, you can use TraCI to control the behavior of individual vehicles,
modify the traffic light phases, or query the current state of the simulation.

## Documentation

The TraCI documentation is available online at
[http://sumo.dlr.de/docs/TraCI.html](http://sumo.dlr.de/docs/TraCI.html). The documentation provides detailed
information on the TraCI API, including a list of available functions and their parameters.

## Examples

There are some [TraCI Tutorials](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tutorials/index.html#traci_tutorials) available.
