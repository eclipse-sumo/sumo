class UniformDestinationWeightCalculator():

    """Calculates weight for each destination from given lane,
       redistributing weights uniformly: first redistributes the total
       traffic among incoming lanes uniformly and then divides the total
       traffic for a lane among all of the destination lanes.

       For example, assume we  have a junction with one incoming road In1
       with 3 incoming lanes and 2 outgoing roads Out1 and Out2,
       having 2 and 3 outgoing lanes, respectively.

                   ___________________
            lane 0 _______     _______ lane 0
       Out2 lane 1 _______     _______ lane 1  In1
            lane 2 _______     _______ lane 2
                          | | |
                          | | |
                          | | |
                      lane 0 1
                           Out1

      Assume that lanes are connected as follows:
      - In1, lane 0 is connected to Out2, lane 0
      - In1, lane 1 is connected to Out2, lane 1
      - In1, lane 2 is connected to Out2, lane 2

      - In1, lane 1 is connected to Out1, lane 0
      - In1, lane 2 is connected to Out1, lane 1

       This weight calculator will redistribute weights as follows:

       1. Distribute the incoming traffic on In1 uniformly on lanes 0, 1 and 2:
          as a result, each lane has been assigned 33,(3)% of the traffic.
       2. Since In1, lane 0 is connected to Out2, lane 0, whole traffic
          from In1, lane 0 is redirected to Out2, lane 0, which makes 33,(3)%
          of the total incoming traffic from In1.
       3. Since In1, lane 1 is connected both to Out2, lane 1 and Out1, lane 0,
          the traffic on that lane (that is, 33,(3)% of the total traffic) is
          spread uniformly among these two lanes, resulting in 16,(6)% of the total
          traffic for each destination lane.
       4. Similarly, In2, lane 2's traffic is spread uniformly among Out2, lane 2
          and Out 1, lane 1, resulting in 16,(6)% of the total traffic for each
          destination lane.

       This, if we ask the calculator for weight assigned to In1, lane 0, we get
       33,(3) as a result; if we ask for weight assigned to In1, lane 1, we get
       16,(6) as a result.

       Note: If you want to provide your own weight calculator (based on Gaussian
       distribution, for example), simply provide a class with calculate_weight
       method. The method's signature may need to be changed in that case. """
