	Vehicle data for VW e-up! (A segment) used for the results in
  (DOI: 10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564463).

	All parameters were either obtained from publicly available sources or
  estimated.
	The power loss map was created with the electric machine design tool
  developed by Kalt et. al. (DOI: 10.1109/EVER.2019.8813601).
	
	If you use this model for academic research, you are highly encouraged to cite
