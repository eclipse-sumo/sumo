 - About-dialog debugged
 - Message window scrolls if new text is appended
- Router
 - Output holding the number of loaded, build, and discarded routes added
 - --move-on-short function implemented
 - Bug on repeatedly emitted vehicles patched

 - added missing pictures
 - resized some pictures
 - improved the visibility of XML-format descriptions
... and some other things ...

Changes from pre0.8.3 to 0.8.0
Mainly the try to make a working release... Furthermore:
- More detectors
- Aggregated views
- Porting to FOX

Changes from pre0.8.2 to pre0.8.3
Mostly functioning and stable. The changes
- Linux-building patched
- Added a preliminary visualisation of junctions and detectors
- The detectors were reimplemented
- Vehicles and vehicle types now contain a certain color (not yet chooseable)
- Traffic lights may now have offsets
- Different other, smaller things
- Changes from pre0.8 to pre0.8.2
- I decided to post the next pre-release that fast as a bug within the netconversion module strongly disallowed the usage of the package.
- As the network generator is not working yet, but still is included within the package, a further release will be out win the next days.
- Netconversion bug removed
- Preliminary junction display
- Preliminary netgenerator

Changes from 0.7.1 to pre0.8
- Further applications added: router, od2trips-converter, tagreader
- A graphical user interface
- Further import possibilities added: ArcView, Visum, Vissim (partly in work), ARTEMIS
- A new concept of the microsimulation
- Traffic lights simulation
- Working lane changing
