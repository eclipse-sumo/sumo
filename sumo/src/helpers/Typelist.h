// Each takes a number of arguments equal to its numeric suffix
// The arguments are type names. TYPELIST_NN generates a typelist containing

// Change log:
// June 09, 2001: Fix bug in parameter list of macros TYPELIST_23 to TYPELIST_27
//      (credit due to Dave Taylor)
// June 20, 2001: ported by Nick Thurn to gcc 2.95.3. Kudos, Nick!!!
// November 22, 2001: fixed bug in DerivedToFront
//      (credit due to Gianni Luciani who noticed the bug first;
//          Adam Wilkshire;
//          Friedrik Hedman who fixed the bug but didn't send the fix;
//          Kevin Cline who sent the first actual fix)
// May 13, 2002: TYPELIST_46 called TYPELIST_45 with only 44 parameters.
