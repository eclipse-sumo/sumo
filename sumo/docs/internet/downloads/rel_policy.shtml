<b>Version numbering</b>
<p>
From version 0.8.3 on we'd like to use the following numbering scheme: a.x.y<br><br>
This is a common naming scheme for open source projects and has the following meanings:<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>a:</b> The major release number;<br>actually we do not suppose to get over zero until the end of this year as one of the simulation's major features - the multimodality - is not yet implemented
    <li><b>x:</b> The minor release number;<br>indicates the closure of some subwork (such as multithreading, new detector scheme atc.), so you can expect some new features<br>Furthermore, you can also expect that some of the used formats change.
    <li><b>y:</b> The subrelease number indicating that some new features are available but possibly not fully developed. If x is even, no formats or API functions will be changed. If x is odd, both API functions and formats may change.
</ul>
The major reason for such a complicated procedure is that during the development at such an early stage, some of the formats used, for example the one for the network change over time. This requires a rebuilding/reconversion of the networks used.<br>
There is no possibility to avoid it, in fact, but at least we want to provide our user's information about the necessarity to do it.
</p>


<b>Release period</b>
<p>
We will try to increase the frequency in comparison to the past and to release a subrelease once a month. If you want to keep absolutely up to date, we advice you to use the sources from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sumo/cvs" class="SUMOInLineLink" >cvs</a> archive which are compileable and running in most cases.
