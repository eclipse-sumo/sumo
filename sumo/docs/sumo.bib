	for developing and testing traffic models of different granularity.
	Although our major intrest is the replication of traffic within larger
	areas, both the current research on traffic safety and the desire
	to improve the quality of microscopic simulations makes it necessary
	to deal with the car driver?s cognition on a finer scale. This paper
	presents our model assumptions for such sub-microscopic simulations,
	which are based on results from cognitive psychology. Although some
	preliminary work of this type is available, most of these applications
	are not open to the public, which makes them useless for scientific
	purposes. the cognition simulations availabele up to now mostly deal
	withmemory processes and are not easily extendable by further structures
	such as vehickles with their dynamics or a representation of the
	simulated environment. These considerations motivated us to develop
	the above mentioned model from scratch. The design of the model described
	herein includes sub-models of a human being?s perception, visual
	attention, internal environment representation and decision making
	as well as the execution of actions in a simulated vehicle. Results
	both from cognitive psychology and the research on human-machine
	interaction are incorporated. This paper reveals our premises for
	a driver?s cognition model and describes the model itself, followed
	by a discussion of the model?s restrictions. As the implementation
	process is not yet closed, only some basic results are presented
	and a look into the furture of the model is given.},

  abstract = {Research on autonomous vehicles has come a long way since first findings,

	are increasingly acclaimed by the research community. Particularly
	with robotics simulators, autonomous
	
	vehicles were provided with a suitable test-bed for experimentation
	of new methodologies
	
	such as long-term navigation algorithms, map building and intelligent
	reasoning. However,
	
	when it concerns the deployment and validation of such vehicles in
	a larger urban traffic scenario,
	
	robotics simulators do not seem to provide the required functionality
	for road traffic analysis, or
	
	inter-vehicular communication infrastructure as they seem present
	in todays traffic simulators.
	
	The improvement of such features is the key for the successful practical
	deployment of such a
	
	critical system.
	
	
	The main objective of this dissertation is the integration of two
	types of simulators, namely a
	
	robotics and a traffic simulator. This integration will enable autonomous
	vehicles to be deployed
	
	in a rather realistic traffic flow as an agent entity (on the traffic
	simulator), at the same time it
	
	simulates all its sensors and actuators (on the robotics counterpart).
	Also, the statistical tools
	
	available in the traffic simulator will allow practitioners to infer
	what kind of advantages such a
	
	novel technology will bring to our everydays lives. Furthermore,
	the current features and issues on
	
	current robotics and traffic simulators are presented and a taxonomy
	for selecting these simulators
	
	is proposed. An architecture for the integration of the aforementioned
	simulators is proposed and
	
	implemented in the light of the most desired features of such software
	environments.
	
	
	To assess the usefulness of the platform architecture towards the
	expected realistic simulation
	
	facility, a comprehensive system evaluation is also performed and
	critically reviewed, leveraging
	
	the feasibility of the integration. Further developments and future
	perspectives are pinpointed up
	
	in the end.},

	approach is to increase vehicle safety by advanced and intelligent

	solutions that only consider information coming from onboard sensors.

	New approaches are now dealing with co-operative technologies that

	infrastructures for updated traffic data acquisition, recognition
	of traffic congestion due to accidents or other sudden incidents,
	local dynamic map data updates and driver warning. One key technology

	sensor data, whereby unprocessed sensor data and satellite pseudo
	range information will be exchanged between the vehicles within a
	dedicated radio range. These data, when compared with the onboard
	data, will finally enable the creation of virtual images of a vehicle?s
	surrounding using special microscopic traffic modelling algorithms.

  abstract = {Traffic applications, in which vehicles are equipped with a radio
	interface and communicate directly with each other and the road traffic
	infrastructure are a promising field for ad-hoc network technology.
	Vehicular applications reach from entertainment to traffic information
	systems, including safety aspects where warning messages can inform
	drivers about dangerous situations in advance. As performance tests
	of the real system are very expensive and not comprehensive, today's
	evaluations are based on analysis and simulation via traffic simulators.
	In order to investigate the impact of traffic information systems
	there are two options: First, traffic simulators can be extended
	by application code and a simplified model for wireless communication.
	Second, existing network simulators can be coupled with existing
	traffic simulators. We favor the coupling of existing and well known
	simulators as we believe that the wireless communication characteristics
	influence the data transfer significantly and an oversimplified transmission
	model can lead to flawed results. In this paper we describe the feedback
	loop between traffic and network simulators named traffic control
	interface (TraCI) and outline its versatility. We explain its use
	to determine possible energy consumption reduction when traffic lights
	send their phase schedules to vehicles.},

  abstract = {Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) enable communication among vehicles
	as well as between vehicles and roadside infrastructures. Currently
	available software tools for VANET research still lack the ability
	to asses the usability of vehicular applications. In this article,
	we present Traffic Control Interface (TraCI) a technique for interlinking
	road traffic and network simulators. It permits us to control the
	behavior of vehicles during simulation runtime, and consequently
	to better understand the influence of VANET applications on traffic
	patterns. In contrast to the existing approaches, i.e., generating
	mobility traces that are fed to a network simulator as static input
	files, the online coupling allows the adaptation of drivers' behavior
	during simulation runtime. This technique is not limited to a special
	traffic simulator or to a special network simulator. We introduce
	a general framework for controlling the mobility which is adaptable
	towards other research areas. We describe the basic concept, design
	decisions and the message format of this open-source architecture.
	Additionally, we provide implementations for non-commercial traffic
	and network simulators namely SUMO and ns2, respectively. This coupling
	enables for the first time systematic evaluations of VANET applications
	in realistic settings.},
