      <title>What is SUMO?</title>

      <para>SUMO is a microscopic road traffic simulation package. In the near
      future it will be extended to model other transit modes simultaneously
      with ordinary car traffic.</para>

    <sect1 id="user_chp01-opensource">
      <title>Why open source?</title>

      <para>Two thoughts stood behind the release of the package as open
      source. At first the fact that every traffic research organisation is
      forced to implement an own simulation package; some people are
      interested in traffic light optimisation, other try to find mistakes
      made during the design of a road network. Both need some kind of a
      simulation package and have to implement a framework containing input
      and output functions and other things from scratch. So the first idea
      was to give them a basic framework - containing all needed methods for a
      simulation - they can put own ideas into. The second idea is to supply a
      common test bed for models, especially car models, to the community to
      make them comparable. Due to different architectures of traffic
      simulations such comparisons on a wide scale are not possible by
      now.</para>

      <para>From version 0.8 on, we want not only supply the sources, but also
      the compiled binaries for MS Windows. We have abandonned the idea of
      releasing binaries for Linux due to large variety of the target
      systems.</para>

      <para>If you are a Windows user, you should decide whether you primary
      want to use the software only or also extend it. In the first case, you
      should download the binaries. All needed libraries are included. In the
      latter case, please download the source distribution and compile it for
      your own. The description of the building process is found within a
      separate document located <ulink
      url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/gen/sumo_howto_building.shtml">here</ulink>.
      If you have built the package on a system not included within our binary
      distribution, please let us know and send it to us, so that we can
      include it into the pages.</para>

      <para>When using Linux, you probably have to compile SUMO from the
      sources. A description about how to do this is located <ulink
      url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/gen/sumo_howto_building.shtml">here</ulink>.</para>

      <para>The SUMO-package also contains some further scripts which are
      located within the <filename>tools</filename>-folder. To execute them
      you'll need to have <ulink url="http://www.python.org/">python</ulink>

      and its subfolders. Please remark that almost all applications are
      command line tools, what means that no window pops up if you start it,
      you have to open a shell window first.</para>

      <para>Most of the examples come with a configuration-file so that may be

        <title>Simulation types</title>

        <para>SUMO is a microscopic, space continuous and time discrete
        traffic simulation.</para>

        <para>In traffic research four classes of traffic flow models are
        distinguished according to the level of detail of the simulation. In
        <emphasis>macroscopic</emphasis> models traffic flow is the basic
        entity. <emphasis>Microscopic</emphasis> models simulate the movement
        of every single vehicle on the street, mostly assuming that the
        behaviour of the vehicle depends on both, the vehicle's physical
        abilities to move and the driver's controlling behaviour (see <ulink
        url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/bibliography.shtml#ChowdhurySantenSchadschneider2000">[Chowdhury,
        Santen, Schadschneider, 2000]</ulink>). Within SUMO, the microscopic
        model developed by Stefan Krauß is used (see <ulink
        url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/bibliography.shtml#Krauss1998_1">[Krauss1998_1]</ulink>,
        <ulink
        url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/bibliography.shtml#Krauss1998_2">[Krauss1998_2]</ulink>),
        extended by some further assumptions. <emphasis>Mesoscopic</emphasis>
        simulations are located at the boundary between microscopic and
        macroscopic simulations. Herein, vehicle movement is mostly simulated
        using queue approaches and single vehicles are moved between such
        queues. <emphasis>Sub-microscopic</emphasis> models regard single
        vehicles like microscopic but extend them by dividing them into
        further substructures, which describe the engine's rotation speed in
        relation to the vehicle's speed or the driver's preferred gear
        switching actions, for instance. This allows more detailed
        computations compared to simple microscopic simulations. However,
        sub-microscopic models require longer computation times. This
        restrains the size of the networks to be simulated.</para>

        <para>Within a space-continuous simulation each vehicle has a certain
        position described by a floating-point number. In contrast,
        space-discrete simulations are a special kind of cellular automata.
        They use to divide streets into cells and vehicles driving on the
        simulated streets "jump" from one cell to another.</para>

        <para>Almost every simulation package uses an own model for vehicle
        movement. Almost all models are so-called
        "<emphasis>car-following-models</emphasis>": the behaviour of the
        driver is herein meant to be dependent on his distance to the vehicle
        in front of him and of this leading vehicle's speed. Although SUMO is
        meant to be a test bed for such vehicle models, only one is
        implemented by now, an extension to the one developed by Stefan Krauß.
        Other obstacles, such as traffic lights, are of course considered
        herein, too.</para>

        <para>It seems obvious, that each driver is trying to use to shortest
        path through the network. But when all are trying to do this, some of
        the roads - mainly the arterial roads - would get congested reducing
        the benefit of using them. Solutions for this problem are known to
        traffic research as <emphasis>dynamic user assignment</emphasis>. For
        solving this, several approaches are available and SUMO uses the
        dynamic user assignment approach developed by Christian Gawron (see
        <ulink
        url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/bibliography.shtml#Gawron1998_1">[Gawron1998_1]</ulink>).</para>

        <para>At first, you need the network the traffic to simulate takes
        place on. As SUMO is meant to work with large networks, we mainly
        concentrated our work on importing networks and the computation of
        further needed values. Due to this, no graphical editor for networks
        is available, yet. Beside information about a network's roads,
        information about traffic lights is needed.</para>

        <para>Further, you need information about the traffic demand. While
        most traffic simulation use a statistical distribution which is laid
        over the network, each vehicle within SUMO knows its route. Within
        this approach, the route is a list of edges to pass. Although this
        approach is more realistic, it also induces a large amount of data
        needed to describe the vehicle movements. By now, routes are not
        compressed within SUMO and so may be several MB large. We will
        possibly change this in future.</para>

        <title>Main Software Paradigms</title>

        <para>Two basic design goals are approached: the software shall be
        fast and it shall be portable. Due to this, the very first versions
        were developed to be run from the command line only - no graphical
        interface was supplied at first and all parameter had to be inserted
        by hand. This should increase the execution speed by leaving off slow
        visualisation. Also, due to these goals, the software was split into
        several parts. Each of them has a certain purpose and must be run
        individually. This is something that makes SUMO different to other
        simulation packages where the dynamical user assignment is made within
        the simulation itself, not via an external application like here. This
        split allows an easier extension of each of the applications within
        the package because each is smaller than a monolithic application
        doing everything. Also, it also allows the usage of faster data
        structures, each adjusted to the current purpose, instead of using
        complicated and ballast-loaded ones. Still, this makes the usage of
        SUMO a little bit uncomfortable in comparison to other simulation
        packages. As there are still other things to do, we are not thinking
        of a redesign towards an integrated approach by now.</para>

      <para>The parameter <option>--output-file</option> has the default value

        using <sgmltag>fromnode="<replaceable>&lt;NODE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
        tonode="<replaceable>&lt;NODE_ID&gt;</replaceable>" </sgmltag>or you
        give their positions using
        <sgmltag>xfrom="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"
        yfrom="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>
        xto="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"
        yto="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"</sgmltag>. In the
        second case, nodes will be build automatically at the given positions.
        Each edge is unidirectional and starts at the
        "<sgmltag>from</sgmltag>"-node and ends at the
        "<sgmltag>to</sgmltag>"-node. If a name of one of the nodes can not be
        dereferenced (because they have not been defined within the nodes
        file) an error is generated (see also the documentation on
        "<option>--dismiss-loading-errors</option>" in subchapter "<link
        linkend="user_chp04-xml_descriptions-running">Building the
        Network</link>").</para>

        <para>For each edge, some further attributes should be supplied, being
        the number of lanes the edge has, the maximum speed allowed on the
        edge, the length the edge has (in meters). Furthermore, the priority
        may be defined optionally. All these values - beside the length in
        fact - may either be given for each edge using according attributes or
        you can omit them by giving the edge a "<sgmltag>type</sgmltag>". In
        this case, you should also write a type-file (see subchapter "<ulink
        url="#user_chp04-xml_descriptions-types">Types Descriptions</ulink>").
        A type with this name should of course be within the generated
        type-file, otherwise an error is reported. Even if you supply a type,
        you can still override the type's values by supplying any of the
        parameter <sgmltag>nolanes</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>speed</sgmltag> and
        <sgmltag>priority</sgmltag>. You may also leave the edge parameter
        completely unset. In this case, default-values will be used and the
        edge will have a single lane, a default (unset) priority and the
        maximum allowed speed on this edge will be 13.9m/s being around
        50km/h. The length of this edge will be computed as the distance
        between the starting and the end point.</para>

        <para>As an edge may have a more complicated geometry, you may supply
        the edge's shape within the <sgmltag>shape</sgmltag> tag. If the
        length of the edge is not given otherwise, the distances of the shape
        elements will be summed. The information
        <sgmltag>spread_type="center"</sgmltag> forces
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> to spread lanes to both sides of
        the connection between the begin node and the end node or from the
        list of lines making up the shape. If not given, lanes are spread to
        right, as default.</para>

        <title>Types Descriptions</title>

        <para>As mentioned, road types are meant to be used to ease the
        definition of edges. As described above, the description of an edge
        should include information about the number of lanes, the maximum
        speed allowed on this edge and the edge's priority. To avoid the
        explicit definition of each parameter for every edge, one can use road
        types, which encapsulate these parameter under a given name. The
        format of this definition is: <sgmltag>&lt;type

        nolanes="<replaceable>&lt;INT&gt;</replaceable>"
        speed="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"

          </itemizedlist>The information about the nodes the edge starts and
        ends at is not given within the types' descriptions. They can only be

        types in edge definitions:</para>

        <para>As you can see, we have joined the edges into three classes "a",

          <para>If you have tried the version 0.7 you have possibly missed the
          possibility to specify the connections between the edges for
          yourself. This is now possible using a further file, the connections
          file. The connection file specifies which edges outgoing from a
          junction may be reached by a certain edge incoming into this
          junction and optionally also which lanes shall be used on both
          sides.</para>

          <para>If you only want to describe which edges may be reached from a
          certain edge, this definition could look something like this:
          <sgmltag>&lt;connection
          from="<replaceable>&lt;FROM_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          to="<replaceable>&lt;T0_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"/&gt;</sgmltag>.
          This tells <application>NETCONVERT</application> not only that
          vehicles shall be allowed to drive from the edge named
          <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;FROM_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>
          to the edge named
          <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;TO_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>,
          but also prohibits all movements to other edges from
          <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;FROM_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>,
          unless they are specified within this file. Let's repeat the
          parameters:</para>

          <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
            <listitem>
              <para><sgmltag>from</sgmltag>: The name of the edge the vehicles

          </itemizedlist>

          <para>When using this kind of input,
          <application>NETCONVERT</application> will compute which lanes shall
          be used if any of the connected edges has more than one lane. If you
          also want to override this computation and set the lanes by hand,
          use the following: <sgmltag>&lt;connection
          from="&lt;FROM_EDGE_ID&gt;" to="&lt;T0_EDGE_ID&gt;"
          lane="&lt;INT_1&gt;:&lt;INT_2&gt;"/&gt;</sgmltag>. Here, a
          connection from the edge's
          "<sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;FROM_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>"
          lane with the number
          <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;INT_1&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag> is build
          to the lane
          <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;INT_2&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag> of the
          edge
          "<sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;TO_EDGE_ID</replaceable>&gt;</sgmltag>".
          Lanes are counted from the right (outer) to the left (inner) side of
          the road beginning with 0. Again the parameter:</para>

          The junction in the center of this example looks like shown within

          shows what happens when one uses connections to limit the number of
          reachable edges. To do this we built a connections file where we say
          that the horizontal edges ("1si" and "2si") have only connections to
          the edges right to them and the edge in straight direction. The file
          looks like this:</para>

        <para><application>NETCONVERT</application> is able to directly read
        binary NavTech's ArcView databases. To convert such databases, you
        need at least three files: a file with the extension
        "<filename>.dbf</filename>", one with the extension
        ".<filename>shp</filename>" and one with the extension
        "<filename>.shx</filename>". Additionally, having a projection file
        with the extension ".proj" is of benefit. Since version 0.9.2 we do
        not suply the possibility to use different names for the files, so all
        files should have the same name besides the extension. To build your
        network from an ArcView-database use the option
        "<option>--arcview=<replaceable>&lt;FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION&gt;</replaceable></option>":</para>

        <para>The problem is, that not all networks stored as
        ArcView-databases also use this naming scheme. During some further
        work with ArcView-networks, some further options got necessary which
        allow to name the fields the used database contains. The column the
        street name shall be read from may be specified using
        <option>--arcview.street-id
        <replaceable>&lt;STREET_NAME_COLUMN_NAME&gt;</replaceable></option>.
        You can also name the columns the names of the edges' origin and
        destination nodes shall be read from using <option>--arcview.from-id
        <replaceable>&lt;START_NODE_ID_COLUMN_NAME&gt;</replaceable></option>
        and <option>--arcview.to-id
        <replaceable>&lt;END_NODE_ID_COLUMN_NAME&gt;</replaceable></option>.
        If the no information about the starting/ending nodes is given and
        your database does not contain the columns "REF_IN_ID" and
        "NREF_IN_ID", nodes will be placed into the network at the positions
        the streets end.</para>

        <para>Since version 0.9.2 we also allow to override the rather "fuzzy"

        <para>This idea came from John Michael Calandrino.</para>

        <para>Some databases do not contain explicite information about the
        edges' attributes (number of lanes, priority, allowed speed) at all.
        Since version 0.9.4 you can use types as described in "<link
        linkend="user_chp04-xml_descriptions-types">Types Descriptions</link>"
        to describe your edges' attributes. You have to name the column to
        retrieve the information about a street's type from using
        <option>--arcview.type-id
        <replaceable>&lt;TYPE_ID_COLUMN_NAME&gt;</replaceable></option>. Of
        course, you have then to supply a type-file using
        <option>--xml-type-files
        <replaceable>&lt;TYPES_FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> (or
        <option>--types</option> or <option>-t</option> ). If something fails
        with the types or the explicite values, you can catch it using
        <option>--arcview.use-defaults-on-failure</option>. Besides this, you
        can specify your own connections using <option>--xml-connection-files
        <replaceable>&lt;CONNECTIONS_FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> (or
        <option>--xml-connections</option> or <option>-x</option>, see "<ulink
        url="#user_chp04-xml_descriptions-connections">Connection
        Descriptions</ulink>").</para>

        <para>ArcView-networks are (mostly?) encoded using geocoordinates
        which have to be converted to the cartesian coordinates system used by
        <application>SUMO</application>. Our current implementation is not yet
        fully developed, it works for the most cases, but you should not be
        surprised if it fails with a certain network. Contact us in this case,
        please. To describe how to convert the coordinates, you should know in
        which UTM-zone your network is located. Pass this to
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> using <option>--arcview.utm
        <replaceable>&lt;ORIGINAL_UTM_ZONE&gt;</replaceable></option>. If the
        conversion can not be initialised, you may additionally use
        <option>--arcview.guess-projection</option> to let
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> guess the conversion by him
        own.</para>

        <title>Importing VISSIM-networks</title>

        <para>Although Vissim is a microscopic simulation as SUMO is, it
        follows a completely different concept of modelling traffic. Due to
        this, the import is quite clumsy and may not work with all networks.
        Also, we have to insert additional edges into our networks to simulate
        the Vissim-parking places, originally being nodes, which we do not
        have. An usage example could be this one:</para>

        <screen>netconvert --vissim=<replaceable>&lt;VISSIM_FILE&gt;</replaceable> --output-file=<replaceable>MySUMOFile.net.xml</replaceable></screen>

        <para>Vissim-networks do possibly not contain explicit definitions of
        an edge's speed. We have to propagate once set velocities, but even
        then some edges' speeds may not be defined. The option
        "<option>--vissim.default-speed</option>" may change the default speed
        used in the case an edge's speed is not defined. The default value for
        this parameter is 13.89m/s, being around 50km/h. The second parameter
        "<option>--vissim.speed-norm</option>" describes the factor to
        multiply a described flows maximum velocity to gain the velocity to
        use. The default value is 1.</para>

        <para>Furthermore, as we have to use geometrical heuristics, a further
        factor steers the process of converting Vissim-networks: simply
        spoken, "<option>--vissim.offset</option>" holds the information how
        near two nodes must be (in meters) to be joined.</para>

        <para>During import, different actions must be done which may yield in
        some loss of data and may be watched in part by setting the verbose
        option. The additional warnings the import of Vissim-networks
        generates will be described in a further document.</para>

        <para>As the network description may not contain any information about

        The computation is done by dividing the flow through a fix value, 2000
        by default. This yields in a realistic network but fails on 'feeder

        <para>You can convert both the splitted and the unsplitted version of

        prefix as generated by Elmar's converter, an optional path is allowed.

        <title>Importing Networks without Traffic Light Logics</title>

        <para>Some of the supported network formats supply information about
        the logic of the traffic lights, other do not. Due to this, we have to
        compute the traffic lights by our own. Doing this, we do not only have
        to compute the plans, but of course also, on which junction traffic
        lights are positioned. There are several options steering this
        procedure. At first, you have to tell
        <application>NETCONVERT</application>/<application>NETGEN</application>
        that you wish him to guess positions of traffic lights. This is done
        using the "<option>--guess-tls</option>"-option. Then, you have the
        possibility to describe the junctions at which you think a tls shall
        be placed using description of incoming and outgoing edges:
        "<option>--tls-guess.no-incoming-min</option>",
        "<option>--tls-guess.no-incoming-max</option>",
        "<option>--tls-guess.no-outgoing-min</option>" and
        "<option>--tls-guess.no-outgoing-max</option>" constraint the building
        of a tls by the number of the lanes incoming/outgoing edges have. All
        these four options require an int as parameter. Furthermore, you may
        constraint the junctions by giving the minimum/maximum of allowed
        speed on edges that participate:
        "<option>--tls-guess.min-incoming-speed</option>",
        "<option>--tls-guess.max-incoming-speed</option>",
        "<option>--tls-guess.min-outgoing-speed</option>", and
        "<option>--tls-guess.max-outgoing-speed</option>".</para>

        <caution>
          <para>No, we do not have a validated set of these option's settings,
          yet.</para>
        </caution>

        <para>You may also set junctions as tls-controlled using
        "<option>--explicite-tls</option>" or as uncontrolled using
        "<option>--explicite-no-tls</option>". Both options assume to get a
        list of node names divided by ',' as parameter. The behaviour when a
        node is in both lists is undefined.</para>

        <para>If you want to know where traffic lights have been inserted and
        your network is too large to evaluate this by hand, you can force
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> to write a list of POIs where
        each POI is placed on a tls-controlled junction. This allows you to
        tae a look at all the positions tls have been inserted at. The option
        for doing this is <option>--tls-poi-output
        <replaceable>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</replaceable></option> where
        <replaceable>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</replaceable> is the filename to write
        the POIs into.</para>

        <para>Normally, only one traffic lights logic (phases definition) is
        computed per a traffic lights controlled junction, but the algorithm
        we use is able to compute several logics. To force the computation of
        all possible logics, use "<option>--all-logics</option>". Remind, that
        all logics will be written to the network file and that we have no
        tools for further procesing of these logics.</para>

        <para>During the computation of tls-logics among other information we
        have to guess the duration of the phases. The options
        "<option>--traffic-light-green</option>" and
        "<option>--traffic-light-yellow</option>" allow you to give the
        durations of green and yellow lights. Both options assume the duration
        in s as an int as parameter. The duration of having red is dependant
        to the number of other phases and their green and yellow phase
        durations. The green phase length has a default of 20s, yellow lights
        are - if no value is set for this option - computed using the
        "<option>--min-decel</option>" - value described below.</para>

        <para>One has to remind one thing: dead times are necessary to avoid
        collisions of vehicles which do not manage to break as they are too
        near to the traffic light when it switches to red. This time may be
        computed, and is, but depends on the maximum deceleration possibility
        of the vehicles used. As this parameter is not known to the network
        builder at all - the vehicle types are supported to the simulation
        only - the option "<option>--min-decel</option>" (or
        <option>-D</option> for short) is used to set the minimum deceleration
        of vehicles. The default is 3.0 in m/s^2.</para>

        <para>There is no possibility to compute or estimate green light
        districts, yet. You have only the options to shift the computed phases
        by half of their duration or by a quarter of their duration. The
        options for this are: "<option>--tl-logics.half-offset</option>" and
        "<option>--tl-logics.quarter-offset</option>". Both options assume to
        get a list of node names divided by ',' as parameter. The behaviour
        when a node is in both lists or if the node is not meant to be
        controlled by a tls is undefined.</para>

        <title>Guessing On- and Off-Ramps</title>

        <para>Most of the imported network descriptions do not have
        information about highway on- and off-ramps. You can force
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> to guess where on- and off-ramps
        shall be build. To enable this, use the option
        "<option>--guess-ramps</option>". The algorithm assumes that an
        on-ramp shall be build on highway junctions with one incoming and one
        outgoing highway edge and one incoming minor edge and that an off-ramp
        shall be build on highway junctions with one incoming and one outgoing
        highway edge and one outgoing minor edge. You can constrain what a
        highway is by giving its minimum speed of this edge using
        "<option>--ramp-guess.min-highway-speed</option>" and what a minor
        edge is by giving its maximum speed using
        "<option>--ramp-guess.max-ramp-speed</option>". Both options assume a
        float parameter being the speed. Furthermore,
        "<option>--ramp-guess.ramp-length</option>" tells
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> how long the added ramp shall be
        in meters.</para>

        <title>Converting from Geocoordinates</title>

        <para>Most professional networks are not stored using cartesian, but
        geo-coordinates. Since version 0.9.4 NETCONVERT is able to deal with
        such positions. NETCONVERT uses herefor the projection library
        "PROJ.4". This is important for you as a user, because you may have to
        describe the original projection of your file and when doing this, you
        have to describe it using the options offered by PROJ.4. In order to
        enable the reprojection use the option
        <option>--use-projection</option>. You can then add parameter for the
        projection using <option>--proj
        <replaceable>&lt;STRING&gt;</replaceable></option>. The default for
        the projection is "+proj=utm +ellps=bessel +units=m". That means, that
        NETCONVERT assumes the network to be encoded using "universal traverse
        mercator" and the Bessel ellipsoid what resembles what is known as
        WGS84 (as far as we have understood it). Please remark, that when
        giving own description, you should embed it into "" for passing all
        the arguments to PROJ.4.</para>

        <para>If you already know <application>SUMO</application> or if you
        have taken a look at some of the examples you may have noticed that
        vehicles "jump" over a junction instead of driving over them. This
        behaviour was quite appropriate for simulating large scenarios as in
        these cases the simulation error could be neglected (at least we have
        neglected it). Since version 0.9.5 <application>SUMO</application> is
        capable to simulate traffic over the junctions in a way you know it
        from reality. Because inserting inner lanes into a network
        dramatically increases the network's size, junction-internal lanes are
        not build by default. You can allow their building using the option

        <title>Constraining the Input</title>

        <para><application>NETCONVERT</application> offers you some
        possibillities to constrain the read edges what is quite needful if
        one has a large street network but only wants to simulate a part of it
        or only the major roads. The first possibility to constrain the input
        is to name all the edges you want to keep. You can either do this on
        the command line/within your configuration directly using
        <option>--keep-edges
        <replaceable>&lt;EDGE_ID&gt;[,&lt;EDGE_ID&gt;]+</replaceable></option>
        where each <option><replaceable>&lt;EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable></option>
        represents the id of an edge you want to keep or you can save this
        list into a file where each id is stored in a seperate line and then
        let <application>NETCONVERT</application> read this file using
        <option>--keep-edges.input-file
        <replaceable>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</replaceable></option>. In the case you
        are joining edges using <option>--remove-geometry</option> (see "<link
        linkend="user_chp04-further_options-nogeometry">Removing Geometry
        Nodes</link>"), you may also be interested in the option
        <option>--keep-edges.postload</option> which forces
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> to join the edges first and
        remove the unwished afterwards.</para>

        <para>It is also possible to constrain the imported edges by giving a
        minimum velocity that is allowed on an edge in order to include this
        edge into the generated network. Use <option>--edges-min-speed
        <replaceable>&lt;MIN_SPEED&gt;</replaceable></option> for this where
        <option><replaceable>&lt;MIN_SPEED&gt;</replaceable></option> is the

      <title>Automatic Network Generation</title>

      <para><application>NETGEN</application> allows builds abstract networks.
      Three types of networks can be built. All of them are very easy, but may
      be used as examples. You are also greatly invited to extend the
      concepts. Available types are: grid-networks, spider-networks and
      random-networks. You always have to supply the name of the network to
      generate using <option>--output
      <replaceable>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</replaceable></option> or <option>-o
      <replaceable>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</replaceable></option> for short and the
      type of network you want to create. So, exactly one of the following
      switches must be supported: <option>--grid-net</option>,
      <option>--spider-net</option> or <option>--random-net</option>.</para>

      <para>While the type-dependent options are described within the next
      chapters, all types share some command line options. As all networks may
      possess junctions, you are able to set the default type of junctions to
      build using the <option>--default-junction-type</option>-option (or
      <option>-j</option> for short). The following junction types are allowed
      in accordance to the junction types currently known by the simulation:
      <option>priority</option>, <option>traffic_light</option>,
      <option>actuated</option>, <option>agentbased</option>.</para>

      <para><caution>
          <para><option>traffic_light</option> will be mapped to "static"
          within the generated network.</para>
        </caution></para>

      <para>Further, you can specify the default street type by using the same
      options as in the netconvert-application.</para>

      <sect2 id="user_chp04-netgen-grid_like">
        <title>Grid-like Networks</title>

        <para>You are able to describe how many junctions in x- and in
        y-direction you want to be build and how far from each other they
        should be. The parameter for the number of junctions are
        <option>--grid-x-number</option> and <option>--grid-y-number</option>,
        the ones for the distance between the junctions
        <option>--grid-x-length</option> and <option>--grid-y-length</option>.
        If you want to build networks which have the same values for both
        axes, use <option>--grid-number</option> and
        <option>--grid-length</option>. The lengths are given in meters. It is
        possible to give another option <option>--attach-length</option>,
        which adds streets of the given length at the boundary of the grid
        such that all crossings have four streets (It is not yet possible to
        have different attach lengths for x- and y-direction).</para>

        <para>Spider-net networks are defined by the number of axes dividing
        them (parameter <option>--spider-arm-number</option> or
        <option>--arms</option>, default is 13), the number of the circles
        they are made of (<option>--spider-circle-number</option> or

        <para><caution>
            <para>As the number of edges within the middle of the spider net
            may be quite large, it is often not possible to build a traffic
            light junction here. Due to this, this junction is always a
            right-of-way-junction.</para>
          </caution></para>

        <para>Optionally you can omit the central junction of the network by
        specifying <option>--spider-omit-center</option> or
        <option>--nocenter</option>. This also gives an easy way of generating
        a circle network. Using for instance <command>netgen --spider-net
        --spider-omit-center --output-file=MySUMOFile.net.xml</command>will
        create a circle consisting of 13 elements with a radius of

      <title>Closing Thoughts (so far)</title>

      <para><application>NETGEN</application> allows to create networks in a
      very comfortable way. For some small-sized tests of rerouting
      strategies, tls-signals etc., this is probably the best solution to get
      a network one can run some simulations at. The clear naming of the
      streets also eases defining own routes.</para>

      <para>Still, most examples within the data-section were written by hand
      for several reasons. At first, the examples are small enough and one may
      see the effects better than when using
      <application>NETGEN</application>. Furthermore, defining own networks
      using XML-data is more flexible. <application>NETGEN</application> is of
      course useless as soon as you want to simulate the reality.</para>

      <para>Our current state-of-the-art approach for building networks is the
      following:</para>

      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>Get a plain (no tls, no link-2-link-connections, etc.) network
          from our NavTeq database</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Import it using <application>NETCONVERT</application> and
          write the list of imported edges/nodes using the
          <option>--plain-output</option> option</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Build the network from the list of edges/nodes (normally
          setting the options <option>--guess-ramps</option> to true)</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Load the network into <application>GUISIM</application>, try
          to determine where tls are located and which connections between
          edges/lanes are false; A nice possibility to do this is to use
          Google Earth besides to investigate how the network looks in
          reality</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Add <sgmltag>type="traffic_light"</sgmltag> attribute to those
          nodes in your plain file which were found to be controlled by a
          tls</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Add lane-to-lane connections in a previously generated
          connections-file</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Build the network from the modified edges/nodes/connection
          files</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Continue with step 4. until the network is as it shoud
          be</para>
        </step>
      </procedure>

      <para>A good idea is to let some vehicles run through the network while
      investigating it. This will show possible bottleneck that arised from a
      false modelling of the network.</para>

      <para>When using real life networks, we really advice guessing on- and
      off-ramps The on- off-ramps are guessed quite well, we can not state
      this for the tls, because we don't have made any comparisons with real
      life.</para>

    <title>Route Generation</title>

    <sect1 id="user_chp05-introduction" revision="0.9.6">
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>After having your network converted into the SUMO-format, you
      could take a look at it using the gui-version of the simulation (see
      "<link linkend="user_chp07">Simulation-GUI</link>"), but no cars would
      be driving around. You still need some kind of description about the
      vehicles. If you are importing data from other simulation packages, they
      normally bring own route definitions you can use. In case of using
      ArcView or own data or in other cases where you do not have the vehicle
      movements at all, you have to generate them by your own. From now on we
      will use the following nomenclature: A <glossterm>trip</glossterm> is a
      vehicle movement from one place to another defined by the starting edge
      (street), the destination edge, and the departure time. A
      <glossterm>route</glossterm> is an expanded trip, that means, that a
      route definition contains not only the first and the last edge, but all
      edges the vehicle will pass. There are several ways to generate routes
      for SUMO:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>using trip definitions</para>

          <para>As described above, each trip consists at least of the
          starting and the ending edge and the departure time (see Chapter
          "<ulink url="#user_chp05-explicite-trips">Using Trip
          Definitions</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>using flow definitions</para>

          <para>This is mostly the same approach as using trip definitions,
          but you may join several vehicles having the same trips using this
          method (see Chapter "<ulink url="#user_chp05-explicite-flows">Using
          Flow Definitions</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>using flow definitions and turning ratios</para>

          <para>You may also leave out the destination edges for flows and use
          turning ratios at junctions instead (see Chapter "<ulink
          url="#user_chp05-own_routes-jtr">Using the Junction Turning Ratio -
          Router</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>using OD-matrices</para>

          <para>OD-matrices have to be converted to trips first (see Chapter
          "<ulink url="#user_chp05-od2trips">Using OD2TRIPS</ulink>"), then
          from trips to routes (see Chapter "<ulink
          url="#user_chp05-explicite-trips">Using Trip
          Definitions</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>by hand</para>

          <para>You can of course generate route files by hand (see Chapter
          "<ulink url="#user_chp05-explicite-hand">Building Routes 'by
          Hand'</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>using random routes</para>

          <para>This is fast way to fill the simulation with life, but
          definitely a very inaccurate one (see Chapter "<ulink
          url="#user_chp05-own_routes-random">Generating random
          Routes</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>by importing available routes (see Chapter "<ulink
          url="#user_chp05-import_routes">Importing Routes from other
          Simulations</ulink>")</para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>By now, the SUMO-package contains four applications for processing
      routes. <application>DUAROUTER</application> is responsible for
      importing routes from other simulation packages and for computing routes
      using the shortest-path algorithm by Dijkstra.
      <application>JTRROUTER</application> may be used if you want to model
      traffic statistically, using flows and turning percentages at junctions.
      <application>OD2TRIPS</application> helps you to convert OD-matrices
      (origin/destination-matrices) into trips. A new application, the
      <application>DFROUTER</application> was added to the suite for version
      0.9.5. Within the next chapters, at first the mandatory arguments are
      described, then we will show how each of the possible methods of
      generating routes from scratch can be used. In the following, importing
      routes and additional options are given followed by a small
      overview.</para>

      definitions will be imported within the interval given by the options
      <option>--begin</option> (<option>-b</option>) and

      time earlier than the one specified by <option>--begin</option> or later

      do not give a value for the begin / end time step the defaults 0 and
      86400 (one day) will be used, respectively.</para>

      <title>Building Routes from Scratch</title>

      <para>You have either the possibility to generate completely random
      routes or to exactly describe what you want and pass this information to
      <application>DUAROUTER</application> or
      <application>JTRROUTER</application>, which then expand your
      descriptions to routes. As result, a routes file is normally generated
      which you may use within your simulation.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>You have to know that each route should consist of at least
        three edges! On the first, the vehicle will be emitted. As soon as it
        reaches <emphasis>the begin</emphasis> of the last, it will be removed
        from the network. So to see the vehicle running, you should at least
        have one edge in between!</para>

      <sect2 id="user_chp05-explicit" revision="0.9.6">
        <title>Generating own, explicit Routes</title>

        <para>There are three possibilities to describe own routes. The most
        trivial one is to do this by hand. The first way to make more vehicle
        trips more automatically is the usage of trip definitions, the second
        one the usage of flow descriptions. Trip definitions describe the
        movement of a single vehicle giving the departure time, and both the
        origin and the destination edges via their id. Flow descriptions use
        these values too, but instead of describing only one vehicle, the
        description is used for a defined number of vehicles to be emitted
        within a described interval. Due to this, instead of the departure
        time, the period's begin and end times must be supplied and the number
        of vehicles to emit within this interval.</para>

        <para>We will describe both data types less briefly, now.</para>

        <sect3 id="user_chp05-explicite-hand" revision="0.9.5">
          <title>Building Routes 'by Hand'</title>

          <para>The most simple way to get own routes is to edit a routes file
          by hand, but only if the number of different routes is not too high.
          Most of the routes within the examples were written by hand, in
          fact. Before starting, you must know that a vehicle in SUMO consists
          of three parts: a vehicle type which describes the vehicle's
          physical properties, a route the vehicle shall take, and the vehicle
          itself. Both routes and vehicle types can be shared by several
          vehicles. In this case, routes need a further information. Assume
          you want to build a routes file
          "<filename>routes.rou.xml</filename>". Herein, you can define a
          vehicle type as following:</para>

          <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;routes&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;vtype id="type1" accel="0.8" decel="4.5" sigma="0.5" length="5" maxspeed="70"/&gt;</sgmltag>
<sgmltag>&lt;/routes&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

          <para>The values used above are the ones most of the examples use.
          They resemble a standard vehicle as used within the Stefan Krauß'
          thesis besides that the minimum gap between vehicles is not added to
          the length. These values have the following meanings:</para>

          <itemizedlist spacing="compact">

              the numbers are allowed.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Having this defined, you can build vehicles of type "type1".
          Let's do this for a vehicle with an completely own route:</para>

          <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;routes&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;vtype id="type1" accel="0.8" decel="4.5" sigma="0.5" length="5" maxspeed="70"/&gt;</sgmltag>

   <sgmltag>&lt;vehicle id="0" type="type1" depart="0" color="1,0,0"&gt;</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag>&lt;route&gt;beg middle end rend&lt;/route&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;/vehicle&gt;</sgmltag>

<sgmltag>&lt;/routes&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

          <para>Ok, now we have a red (color=1,0,0) vehicle of type "type1"
          named "0" which will start at time 0. The vehicle will drive along
          the streets "beg", "middle", "end", and as soon as it has approached
          the edge "rend" it will be removed from the simulation. Ok, let's
          review a vehicle's attributes:</para>

          <itemizedlist spacing="compact">

              <para><sgmltag>id</sgmltag>: A string holding the id of the

              <para><sgmltag>depart</sgmltag>: The time at which the vehicle
              shall be emitted into the net</para>

              <para><sgmltag>color</sgmltag>: An optional color of the

              the numbers are allowed.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>This vehicle has an own, internal route which is not shared
          with other vehicles. You may also define two vehicles using the same
          route. In this case you have to "externalize" the route by giving it
          an id. From <application>SUMO</application> 0.9.7 on it is no longer
          neccessary to tell SUMO that the route is shared by using the
          <sgmltag>multi_ref</sgmltag> attribute, all routes defined outside
          of vehicles are shared. The vehicles using the route refer it using
          the "<sgmltag>route</sgmltag>"-attribute. The complete change looks
          like this:</para>

          <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;routes&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;vtype id="type1" accel="0.8" decel="4.5" sigma="0.5" length="5" maxspeed="70"/&gt;</sgmltag>

   <sgmltag>&lt;route id="route0" color="1,1,0"&gt;beg middle end rend&lt;/route&gt;</sgmltag>

   <sgmltag>&lt;vehicle id="0" type="type1" route="route0" depart="0" color="1,0,0"/&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;vehicle id="1" type="type1" route="route0" depart="0" color="0,1,0"/&gt;</sgmltag>

<sgmltag>&lt;/routes&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

          <para>You may have noticed, that the route itself also got a color
          definition, so the attributes of a route are:</para>

          <itemizedlist spacing="compact">

          <para>This knowledge should enable you to specify own route
          definitions by hand or using self-written scripts. All routing
          modules are generating route files that match this routes and
          vehicles specification.There are a few important things to consider
          when building your own routes:<itemizedlist>

                <para><emphasis>Routes have to be connected.</emphasis> At the
                moment the simulation does not raise an error if the next edge
                of the current route is not a successor of the current edge.
                The car will simply stop at the end of the current edge and
                will possibly be "teleported" to the next edge after a waiting
                time. This is very likely to change in future versions.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Routes have to contain at least two
                edges.</emphasis> The simulation stops the car at the start of
                the last edge, thus a route consisting of a single edge is
                empty.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>The starting edge has to be at least as long
                as the car starting on it.</emphasis> At the moment cars can

                <para><emphasis>The route file has to be sorted by starting

                define a lot of routes or have large gaps between departure
                times. The simulation parameter
                <option>--route-steps</option>, which defaults to 200, defines
                the size of the time interval with which the simulation loads
                its routes. That means by default at startup only route with
                departure time &lt;200 are loaded, if all the vehicles have
                departed, the routes up to departure time 400 are loaded etc.
                pp. This works only if the route file is sorted. This
                behaviour may be disabled by specifying <option>--route-steps

          supplied to the router using an XML-file. The syntax of a single
          trip definition is: <sgmltag>&lt;tripdef
          id="<replaceable>&lt;ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          depart="<replaceable>&lt;TIME&gt;</replaceable>"
          from="<replaceable>&lt;ORIGIN_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          to="<replaceable>&lt;DESTINATION_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          [type="<replaceable>&lt;VEHICLE_TYPE&gt;</replaceable>"]
          [period="<replaceable>&lt;INT&gt;</replaceable>"
          repno="<replaceable>&lt;INT&gt;</replaceable>"]
          [color="<replaceable>&lt;COLOR&gt;</replaceable>"]/&gt;</sgmltag>.
          You have to supply the edge the trip starts at (origin), the edge
          the trip ends at (destination) and the departure time at least. If
          the type is not given, a default ("SUMO_DEFAULT_TYPE") will be used
          and stored within the routes-file. If the attribute
          <sgmltag>period</sgmltag> is given, not only one vehicle will use
          the route, but every n seconds (where n is the number defined in
          period), a vehicle using this route will be emitted. The number of
          vehicles to emit using this route may be additionally constrained
          using <sgmltag>repno</sgmltag>.</para>

          <title>Using Flow Definitions</title>

          <para>Flow amounts share most of the parameter with trip
          definitions. The syntax is: <sgmltag>&lt;flow
          id="<replaceable>&lt;ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          from="<replaceable>&lt;ORIGIN_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          to="<replaceable>&lt;DESTINATION_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          begin="<replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL_BEGIN&gt;</replaceable>"
          end="<replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL_END&gt;</replaceable>"
          no="<replaceable>&lt;VEHICLES_TO_EMIT&gt;</replaceable>"
          [type="<replaceable>&lt;VEHICLE_TYPE&gt;</replaceable>"]
          [color="<replaceable>&lt;COLOR&gt;</replaceable>"]/&gt;</sgmltag>.
          Notice the following differences: the vehicle does not take a
          certain departure time as not only one vehicle is described by this
          parameter, but a set of, given within the attribute
          "<sgmltag>no</sgmltag>" (short for number). The departure times are
          spread uniformly within the time interval described by
          <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL_BEGIN&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>
          and
          <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL_END&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>.
          All these three attributes must be integer values. The values
          "<sgmltag>period</sgmltag>" and "<sgmltag>repno</sgmltag>" are not
          used herein. Flow definitions can also be embedded into an interval
          tag. In this case one can (but does not have to) leave the tags
          "<sgmltag>begin</sgmltag>" and "<sgmltag>end</sgmltag>" out. So the
          following two snipples mean the same:</para>

          <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;flow id="0" from="edge0" to="edge1" begin="0" end="3600" no="100"/&gt;</sgmltag>
</programlisting>

          <para>and</para>

          <para>As we have to read in the flow definitions completely into the

        <para>you will generate random routes for the time interval given by
        <option>-b(egin)</option> and <option>-e(nd)</option>. In each time
        step as many vehicles will be emitted into the network as given by the
        value of <option>-R</option> (<option>--random-per-second</option>).
        You can also supply values smaller than one. In this case, a single

        1/<option><replaceable>&lt;-R&gt;</replaceable></option> step.
        Example: <option>-R 0.25</option> generates a route description,
        which, when loaded, forces the simulation to emit a single vehicle
        each fourth time step. It is also possible to use this parameter in
        combination with other route definitions, for example supplying some
        fix routes and additionally generate random routes.</para>

        <para>Random routes are not the best way to generate routes. Take a
        look at the network displayed below. This network has two rural and
        many minor roads. Random routes are by now spread all over the network
        and each road is chosen to be the starting or the ending without
        respecting his function. Due to this, the network is filled over with
        cars, coming from and approaching directions, the normal traffic is
        not taking - the normal traffic would concentrate on rural

        <title revision="0.9.7">Using the Junction Turning Ratio -
        Router</title>

        <para>The <application>JTRROUTER</application> is a routing
        applications which uses flows and turning percentages at junctions as
        input. The following parameter must be supplied: the network to route
        the vehicles through, the description of the turning ratios for the
        junctions (defaults may be used for this, too), and the descriptions
        of the flows.</para>

        <para>A call may look like this:</para>

        <para>To describe the turn definitions, one has to build a further
        file. Within this file, for each interval and each edge the list of
        percentages to use a certain follower has to be given. An
        example:</para>

        <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;turn-defs&gt;</sgmltag>

         <sgmltag>&lt;toedge id="myEdge3" probability="0.1"/&gt;</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag>&lt;/fromedge&gt;</sgmltag>

      ... any other edges ...

   <sgmltag>&lt;/interval&gt;</sgmltag>

   ... some further intervals ...

<sgmltag>&lt;/turn-defs&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

        <para>The snippet defines that vehicles coming at the end of edge
        "myEdge0" within the time interval between 0s and 3600s will choose
        the edge "myEdge1" with a probability of 20%, "myEdge2" with a
        probability of 70% and "myEdge3" with a probability of 10%. Another
        possibility to save time on preparing the description is to use
        default values. The parameter <option>--turn-defaults</option>
        (<option>-T</option>)
        <option><replaceable>&lt;TURN_DEFAULTS&gt;</replaceable></option> can
        be used to describe the default ratios that will be used for all
        junctions for all time steps.
        <option><replaceable>&lt;TURN_DEFAULTS&gt;</replaceable></option> is a
        list of doubles, separated by a ','. To achieve the same behaviour as
        in the example above, use <option>--turn-defaults=20,70,10</option>.
        The values will be applied to an edge's following edges beginning at
        the right edge (20%) and ending at the leftmost edge (10%). As the
        number of possible followers changes for different edges, the values
        are resampled for edges which number of following edges differs from
        the number of given turning probability defaults. Given
        <option>--turn-defaults=20,70,10</option> a vehicle using an edge that
        has two followers would use the follower to the right with 55%
        probability, the one to the left with 45%.</para>

        <para>The definitions of the flow is the same as for the
        <application>DUAROUTER</application> with just a single difference: as
        it is not known where the vehicle will leave the network as the route
        it uses is randomly computed, the destination parameter has no meaning
        for jtr-routing and so may be left off. A vehicle leaves the network
        as soon as it comes to a sink edge. As not all networks have sink
        edges defined, one can support a list of edges to be declared as sinks
        using <option>--sinks
        <replaceable>&lt;EDGE_ID&gt;[,&lt;EDGE_ID&gt;]*</replaceable></option>.
        You may also add your sink definitions to a turn-file (XML
        only):</para>

        <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;turn-defs&gt;</sgmltag>
   ... some further turning definitions as above ...
 
   <sgmltag>&lt;sink&gt;<replaceable>&lt;EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>&lt;/sink&gt;</sgmltag>
   ... further sink definitions ...

<sgmltag>&lt;/turn-defs&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

        <para>As theoretically a route may get infinitely long when a vehicle
        is forced to take always the same direction, it is possible to limit
        the route's size using <option>max-edges-factor</option>. This factor,
        multiplied with the number of the used network's edges is the maximum
        number of edges a route may have. With the default of 2.0, a route may
        contain twice as many edges as the network has. Any route longer than
        this size will be marked as invalid. We assume that for each network
        this number has to be chosen again.</para>

      <sect2 id="user_chp05-od2trips" revision="0.9.7">
        <title revision="0.9.7">Using OD2TRIPS</title>

        <para><application>OD2TRIPS</application> computes trips tables from
        O/D (origin/destination) matrices. <application>OD2TRIPS</application>
        assumes the matrix / the matrices to be coded as amounts of vehicles
        that drive from one district to another within a certain time period.
        Because the generated trips must start and end at edges,
        <application>OD2TRIPS</application> requires a mapping of districts to
        edges. During conversion of VISUM networks with
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> districts stored in the VISUM
        input file are parsed and stored within the generated SUMO network
        file. If you do not use VISUM as input, you must build a districts
        file by your own. The format is given in "<link
        linkend="user_chp05-od2trips-districts">Describing the
        Districts</link>", one of the next subchapters. You have to pass the
        file containing the district definitions to
        <application>OD2TRIPS</application> using the
        <option>--net-file</option> (<option>--net</option> or
        <option>-n</option> for short) option.</para>

        <para>Because <application>OD2TRIPS</application> was used only to
        import data stored in VISUM/VISION/VISSIM formats, it assumes O/D to
        be stored in one of the formats used by these applications. Not all
        VISUM/VISION/VISSIM formats are supported, by now only two, namely the
        "V"- and the "O"-format. If you do not own matrices stored in these
        formats, you still have three possibilities: a) convert them into one
        of the supported formats, b) write your own reader for
        <application>OD2TRIPS</application>, or c) convert them into flow
        definitions and then give them to <application>DUAROUTER</application>
        (see Chapter "<ulink url="#user_chp05-explicite-flows">Using Flow
        Definitions</ulink>"). Both supported formats are described in "<link
        linkend="user_chp05-od2trips-matrices">Describing the Matrix
        Cells</link>", one of the next subchapters. You may either give a list
        of matrices to <application>OD2TRIPS</application> using the
        <option>--od-files</option> (<option>--od</option> or
        <option>-d</option> for short) option followed by the list of files
        separated using a ','.</para>

        <para><application>OD2TRIPS</application> reads all matrices and
        generates trip definitions as described in "<link
        linkend="user_chp05-explicite-trips">Using Trip Definitions</link>".
        The generated trip definitions are numbered starting at zero. You can
        also add a prefix to the generated trip definition names using
        <option>--prefix <replaceable>&lt;STRING&gt;</replaceable></option>.
        As usual, they are written to the output file named using the
        <option>--output-file</option> option (<option>--output</option> or
        <option>-o</option> for short). You can specify a vehicle type to be
        added to the trip definitions using <option>--vtype</option> followed
        by the type name. Please remark that vehicles will have no type unless
        not given in the O/D-matrices or defined using this option. If a type
        is spuulied, but you do not want to include it within the output, set
        the <option>--no-vtype</option> option. The command line option
        overrides type names given in the O/D-matrices. The type itself will
        not be generated. Vehicles will be generated for the time period
        between <option>--begin</option> (<option>-b</option>) and
        <option>--end</option> (<option>-e</option>), having 0 and 86400 as
        default values, respectively. The meaning is the simulation step in
        seconds, as usual.</para>

        <para>Because each O/D-matrix cell describes the amount of vehicles to
        be emitted within a certain time period,
        <application>OD2TRIPS</application> has to compute the vehicle's
        explicite departure times. Normally, this is done by using a random
        time within the time interval a O/D-matrix cell describes. It still is
        possible to emit a cell's vehicles with an uniform time between their
        emissions. Use the option <option>--spread.uniform</option> to enable
        this.</para>

        <para>You can scale the amounts stored in the O/D-matrices using the
        <option>--scale</option> option which assumes a float as parameter.
        All read flows will be multiplied with this value, the default is 1.
        When importing O/D-matrices that cover a whole day, you maybe want to
        apply a curve which resembles the spread of the trip begins found in
        reality. Please read the subchapter "<link
        linkend="user_chp05-od2trips-splitting">Splitting large
        matrices</link>" on this.</para>

          <title>Describing the Matrix Cells</title>

          <para>To understand how an O/D-matrix is stored, we should remind
          the meanings of the values stored herein. Each matrix describes a
          certain time period. The indices within the matrix are names of the
          origin/destination districts (normally they are equivalent, both
          lists are the same). The values stored within the matrix are amounts
          of vehicles driving from the according origin district to the
          according destination district within the described time
          period.</para>

          <para>The formats used by ptv are described in the
          VISUM-documentation more detailed. All start with a line where the
          type of the O/D-matrix is given, appended to a '$'. The first
          following character tells in which format the table is stored. Then,
          further characters follow which describe which values are supplied
          additionally within the matrix. For further information we ask you
          to consult the documentation supported by ptv. Herein, only the
          supported variants are described.</para>

          <para>The V-format stores the O/D matrix by giving the number of
          districts first and then naming them. After this, for each of the
          named districts, a list of vehicle amounts that leave this district
          is given, sorted by the destination district names as given in the
          district name list. An example may look like this:</para>

          <title>Splitting large matrices</title>

          <para>Since version 0.9.5 <application>OD2TRIPS</application> allows
          splitting matrices which define a long time period into smaller
          parts which contain definite percentages of the whole. There are two
          ways of defining the amounts the matrix shall be split into. The
          first possibility is to use the option <option>--timeline</option>
          directly. In this case, it should be followed by a list of times and
          probabilities, separated by ','. Each time and probability field is
          made up of two values, an integer time being the simulation time in
          seconds and a floating point number describing the probability.
          These two values are separated using a ':'. At least two values must
          be supplied making the definition of a timeline in this case being
          decribeable by the following BNF-formula:</para>

          <para>&lt;TIME&gt;:&lt;AMOUNT&gt;[,&lt;TIME&gt;:&lt;AMOUNT&gt;]+</para>

          <para>In this case, the matrix will be split into (fields-1) parts
          and each part will have the amount described by the integral within
          the field.</para>

          <para>The second case is rather common in transportation science. It
          allows to split the matrix into 24 subparts - this means the number
          of fields is fixed to 24 - allowing to spread an O/D-matrix over a
          day describing it by hours. To use this, give additionally the
          option <option>--timeline.day-in-hours</option> to
          <application>OD2TRIPS</application>. It the assumes the values from
          the <option>--timeline</option> - option being a list of 24 floats,
          divided by ',', each describing the probability of emitting a
          vehicle within the according hour.</para>

          <para>In both cases, the probabilities are automatically
          normed.</para>

      <para>Dynamic Assignment is used to find out which routes the simulated
      driver really would take. One could assume that everyone is traing to
      use the fastest route. But what is the fastest route? Look at the
      network shown in the next picture. It is abvious, that the fastest route
      is the one in the middle of the network, even when considering the tls
      at the end of this road. But as soon as we insert many vehicles into the
      network, all trying to use this route, the edge located at the center
      soon gets full and vehicles need much more time than estimated to pass
      it. In fact, they need longer to pass this edge than if they would try
      to use one of the outer connections.</para>

      <para>Within Christian Gawron's approach (see <ulink
      url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/bibliography.shtml#Gawron1998_1">[Gawron1998_1]</ulink>),
      which we use, each driver has a list of routes. At the beginning, we
      build a single route for each driver being the shortest route within an
      empty network - not knowing how many vehicles will use this route. You
      may wonder that two files are built. The file you have named as output
      file and a further file having the additional extension ".alt". Within
      this second file route alternatives - the set of all routes the driver
      knows - are stored.</para>

      <para>After having generated the routes, we let the simulation run
      forcing it to generate edge-based dumps (see chapter 6, "<ulink
      url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/gen/user_chp06.shtml#user_chp06-output-edgelanedump">Aggregated
      Lane/Edge States (Edge/Lane-Dumps)</ulink>"). The router is In fact,
      edge-based dumps are the better choice, because the route is not able to
      use lane-based dumps at all. Now, we have the information about the
      state of the network, meaning the real speeds that were driven within
      it, when all vehicles are using the same route. Now we can pass this
      information to a second call to <application>DUAROUTER</application> and
      now - instead of the previous input file - we give the route
      alternatives file as input using the option
      <option>--alternatives</option> (or <option>-a</option> for short). Now,
      <application>DUAROUTER</application> is capable to compute the new
      shortest routes, based on the real speeds within our simulation. In
      order to avoid that again all vehicles will use the currently shortest
      route only some of the drivers will get the new shortest route. Again,
      two files are generated, a route file which contains the current routes
      and a new route alternatives file. The entries within the new
      alternatives file stay the same for all those drivers who keep their old
      route. Those who got a new route assigned, will get this route stored
      additionally to their previous route within the file. Whether a route is
      replaced by a new, better route is depending on how much better the new
      route is and how fast a driver shall forget his old one. There are two
      parameters determining this: <option>--gBeta</option> and
      <option>--gA</option>. Please see (see <ulink

        <title>Automatic Iteration using 'dua-iterate.pl'</title>

        <para>"<command>dua-iterate.pl</command>" helps you to perform the
        computation of a dynamic user assignment. The script needs at least
        two parameter: the path to the folder where your SUMO-binaries are
        located and the number of iteration steps to perform. When started
        with these two options, the script computes the given number of
        dua-steps. As input two files have to be located in the same folder as
        the script: a SUMO-network named "<filename>net.net.xml</filename>"
        and a set of trip definitions named
        "<filename>trips.trips.xml</filename>". if you want to start with
        another routes definition, you have to change this within the script's
        source code.</para>

        <para>Within each iteration step, the script generates a configuration
        file for the <application>DUAROUTER</application> and starts
        <application>DUAROUTER</application> with this configuration file.
        Then, a configuration file for <application>SUMO</application> is
        built and <application>SUMO</application> ist started. Both
        configuration files are competely defined within the script itself. As
        default, for each time step, <application>SUMO</application> will
        generate three dump files with edge-dumps aggregated over 150, 300,
        and 900s, an emissions and a trip information output. The names of
        these outputs are numbered over the iteration steps. If you want to
        change the outputs, you also have to take a look into the script, but
        you should not disable the edge-based dump for aggregation over 900s,
        because this is read by the <application>DUAROUTER</application> in
        the next iteration steps in order to compute the DUA.</para>

        <para>When started with a third parameter, the second parameter given
        will be interpreted as the start iteration step and the third as the

      <title revision="0.9.6">Additional Weights</title>

      <para>From version 0.8.0.1 on, SUMO is capable to load additional
      weights for edges. The idea behind this is to virtually increase the
      costs for an edge in order to make it less attractive to pass.
      Additional weights are used by <application>DUAROUTER</application> only
      and are supplied using the <option>--supplementary-weights
      <replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> (or <option>--add
      <replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> or <option>-S
      <replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option>) - option. A file
      containing additional weights looks like this:</para>

      <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;supplementary-weights&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;interval begin="60" end="119"&gt;</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag>&lt;edge id="1fi" absolute="42" factor="2.5" summand="-21"/&gt;</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag>&lt;edge id="2o" factor="13"/&gt;</sgmltag>

      ... further weights ...

   <sgmltag>&lt;/interval&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;interval begin="120" end="179"&gt;</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag>&lt;edge id="1fi" absolute="48" factor="2.5"/&gt;</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag>&lt;edge id="2o" summand="7"/&gt;</sgmltag>

      ... further weights ...

  <sgmltag> &lt;/interval&gt;</sgmltag>

   ... further intervals ...

<sgmltag>&lt;/supplementary-weights&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

      <para>When additional weights are supplied, the DUA-Router first looks
      whether an additional, absolute value has been provide for the currently
      watched edge (value of the "<sgmltag>absolute</sgmltag>"-attribute for
      the current edge and time). If so, this value will be used. If not,
      either the edge's loaded weight (if available for the current time step)
      or the default value (length/vallowed) will be changed first by applying
      the loaded factor (value of the "<sgmltag>factor</sgmltag>"-attribute
      for the current edge and time) and than by the loaded addend (value of
      the "<sgmltag>summand</sgmltag>"-attribute for the current edge and
      time).</para>

      <para>You can also use GUISIM to generate an additional weights file
      using the interface which appears when choosing "<guimenu>Edit-&gt;Edit

      <title>Using Detectors and DFROUTER</title>

      <para>Since version 0.9.5, the SUMO-package contains a further routing
      module named <application>DFROUTER</application>. The idea behind this
      router is that nowadays, most highways are well equipped with induction
      loops, measuring each of the highways' entering and leaving flows. Given
      this information one may assume that the flows on the highway are
      completely known. <application>DFROUTER</application> uses directly the
      information collected from induction loops to rebuild the vehicle
      amounts and routes. This is done in several steps, being mainly:</para>

        <step>
          <para>Computing (and optionally saving) the detector types in the

      the command line options that steer the process.</para>

        <title>Computing Detector Types</title>

        <para>The idea behind the <application>DFROUTER</application> assumes
        that a network is completely covered by detectors, meaning that all
        off- and on-ramps have an induction loop placed on them. Such an
        information whether an induction loop is a pure source or sink or
        whether it is placed between such is but not given initially. It must
        be computed. To do this, the <application>DFROUTER</application> needs
        the underlying network as well as a list of detector definitions where
        each describes the position of an induction loop. The network, being a
        previously build SUMO-network, is supplied to the
        <application>DFROUTER</application> as usually using the <option>(
        --net-file | --net | -n )
        <replaceable>&lt;SUMO_NET_FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> - option,
        the list of induction loops using <option>--detector-files</option>
        (or <option>--detectors</option> or <option>-d</option> for short)
        <option><replaceable>&lt;DETECTOR_FILE&gt;[,&lt;DETECTOR_FILE&gt;]+</replaceable></option>.
        A detector file should look as following:</para>

        <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;detectors&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;detector_definition id="<replaceable>&lt;DETECTOR_ID&gt;</replaceable>" lane="<replaceable>&lt;LANE_ID&gt;</replaceable>" pos="<replaceable>&lt;POS&gt;</replaceable>"/&gt;</sgmltag>
... further detectors ...<sgmltag>
&lt;/detectors&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

        <para>This means that each detector is initially described using its
        id, a lane it is placed on, and a position on the lane. To be
        exact:</para>

        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
          <listitem>
            <para><sgmltag>id</sgmltag>: A string holding the id of the
            detector</para>

          <listitem>
            <para><sgmltag>lane</sgmltag>: The id of the lane the detector
            lies on. Must be a lane within the network.</para>

            <para><sgmltag>pos</sgmltag>: The position on the lane the
            detector shall be laid on in meters. The position must be a value
            between -1*lane's length and the lane's length. In the case of a
            negative value, the position will be computed backward from the
            lane's end (the position the vehicles drive towards).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Given a network and the list of detectors,
        <application>DFROUTER</application> assigns types to detectors and
        saves the so extended list into a file if the option
        <option>--detectors-output
        <replaceable>&lt;DETECTOR_OUTPUT_FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> is
        given. This list looks like the input described above except that an
        aditional attribute is given for each detector,
        "<sgmltag>type</sgmltag>", which may have one of the following values:
        "<sgmltag>source</sgmltag>", "<sgmltag>sink</sgmltag>",
        "<sgmltag>between</sgmltag>", and "<sgmltag>discarded</sgmltag>". You
        can also generate a list of points of interests (POIs) which can be
        read by GUISIM where each POI represents a detector and is colored by
        the detector type: green for source detectors, red for sink detectors,
        blue for in-between detectors, and black for discarded detectors. To
        force DFROUTER to do this, use <option>--detectors-poi-output
        <replaceable>&lt;POI_FILENAME&gt;</replaceable></option>.</para>

        <para>When wished, if for example other parameters chage, the extended
        <replaceable>&lt;DETECTOR_OUTPUT_FILE&gt;</replaceable> can be fed
        back again into <application>DFROUTER</application> instead of the
        previous <replaceable>&lt;DETECTOR_FILE&gt;</replaceable>. In this
        case the detector types do not have to be computed again. To force
        <application>DFROUTER</application> to recompute the types though, use
        <option>--revalidate-detectors</option>.</para>

        <para>Now that we do know where vehicles enter and where they leave

        only contains routes, no vehicle type definitions and no vehicles. In

        <title>Saving Flows and other Values</title>

        <para>If flow definitions were supplied, we can let the
        <application>DFROUTER</application> save the computed vehicles
        together with their routes. Because vehicles will be emitted at the
        source detectors which are placed at certain positions of the
        networks' lanes, emitters (see "<link
        linkend="user_chp06-vehicle_handling-emitter">Emitter</link>") are
        used to insert those vehicles into the network. You can force the
        <application>DFROUTER</application> to generate such emitters using
        <option>--emitters-output
        <replaceable>&lt;EMITTER_OUTPUT_FILE&gt;</replaceable></option>. This
        file will contain emitter declarations for each of the source
        detectors. If no value is given, emitters will not be written.
        Accompanying, there will be emitter definitions written named
        "<filename>emitter_<replaceable>&lt;DETECTOR_ID&gt;</replaceable>.def.xml</filename>"
        where <replaceable>&lt;DETECTOR_ID&gt;</replaceable> is the id of the
        according source detector. These definitions are called within the
        <replaceable>&lt;EMITTER_OUTPUT_FILE&gt;</replaceable> and contain
        vehicles which depart the emitter in accordance to the read flows and
        have routes computed using the flows.</para>

        <para>As some approaches use a speed limit to avoid open-end boundary
        problems, the <application>DFROUTER</application> can generate a list
        of speed triggers (see "<link
        linkend="user_chp06-management-vss">Variable Speed Signs
        (VSS)</link>") placed on the positions of sink detectors. The name to
        save the declaration of these speed triggers into is given using the
        option <option>--speed-trigger-output
        <replaceable>&lt;VSS_OUTPUT_FILE&gt;</replaceable></option>. The
        according speed trigger definitions will be written into files named
        "<filename>vss_<replaceable>&lt;DETECTOR_ID&gt;</replaceable>.def.xml</filename>"
        where <replaceable>&lt;DETECTOR_ID&gt;</replaceable> is the name of
        the according sink detector.</para>

        <para>In order not to end vehicle routes on off-ramps, it is possible
        to place rerouters (see "<link
        linkend="user_chp06-management-rerouter">Rerouter</link>") at the
        positions of the sink detectors, too. Giving the option
        <option>--end-reroute-output
        <replaceable>&lt;REROUTER_OUTPUT_FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> will
        generate a list of rerouter declarations. Please remark that in this
        case, no rerouter definitions are written, because the
        <application>DFROUTER</application> has no further information about
        possible routes beyond the area covered by the detectors.</para>

        <para>It's quite nice to have the possibility to check whether the
        simulation does what one wants. To validate whether the same flows are
        found within the simulation as within the reality, the option
        <option>--validation-output
        <replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DETECTORS_OUTPUT&gt;</replaceable></option> may
        be helpful. It generates a list of detector definitions (E1/induction
        loops, see "<link
        linkend="user_chp06-output-detectors-e1">E1-Detectors (Induction
        Loops)</link>") placed at the positions of sink and in-between
        detectors. Their output will be saved into files named
        "<filename>validation_det_<replaceable>&lt;DETECTOR_ID&gt;</replaceable>.xml</filename>"
        and should be easily comparable to the detector flows previously fed
        to the router. The option<option>
        --validation-output.add-sources</option> will let
        <application>DFROUTER</application> also build E1-detectors for source
        detectors which are place 1m behind the real-life detector's
        position.</para>

      <title>Closing Thoughts (so far)</title>

      <para>If you are want to simulate small scenarios only, with a few
      vehicles, you probably should try to work with routes where each vehicle
      is duplicated. This needs only a small amount of editing and lets you
      fill the simulation fast. This has been done for most of the examples
      within the example data. Trying to generate own OD-matrices is not to be
      adviced, because handling of such is not really well supported by the
      package. Using flows generated by hand may be a possibility, but for
      small scenarios, flows seem more clumsy than routes.</para>

      <para>In some cases, flows at each junction are counted and how many
      vehicles are driving in which direction. This is exactly what

    <para>Having the network description and the routes you have everything to
    perform a simulation. The fastest way to get results - their different
    types will be described within the following sub-chapters - is to use the
    SUMO - command line simulation. This command line tool does not generate
    any graphical output as the SUMO-GUI does, but is much faster in
    execution.</para>

    <para>To start a simulation, you have to supply the following

      <title>Output Generation</title>

      <para>Due to its scientific purpose, SUMO tasks lie beyond simple

        <para>One possibility to generate output is to use so called

        such as induction loops but also some virtual ones. Basically, the
        main distinction between detector types SUMO offers is their
        dimension. The next list shows all available detector types. Their

          <para>An e2-detector is defined the following way:</para>

          <para>Most of the attributes have the same meaning as for induction
          loops. As an areal detector has a certain length,
          "<sgmltag>length</sgmltag>" must be supplied as a further parameter.
          It may be a negative number which lets the detector be extended
          upstream to the given beginning position. The optional parameter
          "<sgmltag>cont</sgmltag>" let's the detector continue over the
          current lane onto this lane's predecessors when the detector's
          length plus his position is larger than the place available on the
          lane.</para>

          <para>To explain this vast amount of measures, a short note about
          how an e2-detector works is needfull. An e2-detector takes note
          about each vehicle that enters the area. As long as the vehicle does
          not leave the area completely, its state is collected in each time
          step during the interval. Each vehicle state in this case is called
          a "data sample" and the output of an e2-detector is made up from all
          data samples of all vehicles within the are during the complete data
          collection ("<sgmltag>freq</sgmltag>") interval.</para>

          <para>As an e2-detector covers a lane and vehicles are sorted on
          these, it is possible to recognize jams along the detector's area
          and measure them. Because more than one jam may take place at the
          area at one time, the values cover as well averaged measures of all
          jams ("<sgmltag>jamLengthIn...Sum</sgmltag>") as explicite measures
          of the longest (maximum) jam. For the longest jam, both averaged
          ("<sgmltag>meanMaxJamLengthIn...</sgmltag>") and maximum
          ("<sgmltag>maxJamLengthIn...</sgmltag>") values are written.</para>

          <note>
            <para>The jam length in meters may be more than a sum of the
            vehicles lengths, because the place between vehicle is also taken
            into account.</para>
          </note>

          <para>Besides jam computation, the durations vehicles are halting
          are collected. They are both collected over the whole time span a
          vehicle is on the detector area
          ("<sgmltag>...HaltingDuration</sgmltag>" and
          "<sgmltag>haltingDurationSum</sgmltag>"), and explicite for each
          interval ("<sgmltag>...IntervalHaltingDuration</sgmltag>" and
          "<sgmltag>intervalHaltingDurationSum</sgmltag>").</para>

          Detectors)</title>

          <para>The descriptions of E3-detectors have to include the set of
          entry- and the set of exit-cross-sections. Due to this, it is not
          possible to use a single tag to specify a detector. Instead, the
          description consists of the following parts:</para>

          values will be computed as the default-value for measures is used
          and aggregated over a time of 300s. They will be written into the
          file "<filename>e3_1.xm</filename>l" lying in the subfolder of the
          folder the configuration was read in/the program has been started

          <para>As for e2-detectors, the measures generated by e3-detectors
          may be grouped by the way they are computed. The plain measures take
          only those vehicles into account that have left the detector area
          within the described interval. Additionally, measures of the
          vehicles that are still inside the area are generated (postfix
          "<sgmltag>Within</sgmltag>"), containing both measures valid for the
          whole ride through the area and measures made up of only those
          samples that were collected within the current interval
          ("<sgmltag>...Interval...</sgmltag>"). The value are described one
          by one in the following table.</para>

        <title>Network State Dump</title>

        <para>In the hope that every user wants to know different things and
        is able to write a tool that parses this information from a not
        aggregated output, the network dump was the first output capability
        we've implemented. To force SUMO to build a file that contains the
        network dump, extend your command line (or configuration) parameter by
        <option>--netstate-dump</option> (or <option>--ndump</option> or
        <option>--netstate</option>)
        <option><replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option>.
        <option><replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> is hereby the
        name of the file the output will be written to. Any other file with
        this name will be overwritten, the destination folder must
        exist.</para>

        <para>The network dump is a xml-file containing for each time step
        every edge of the network with every lane of this edge with all
        vehicles on this lane. For each vehicle, his name, speed and position
        on his lane are written. A network dump-file looks like this:</para>

        <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;sumo-netstate&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;timestep time="<replaceable>&lt;TIME_STEP&gt;</replaceable>"&gt;</sgmltag>

            ... more vehicles if any on this lane ...

         <sgmltag>&lt;/lane&gt;</sgmltag>

         ... more lanes if the edge possesses more ...

      <sgmltag>&lt;/edge&gt;</sgmltag>

      ... more edges ....

<sgmltag>   &lt;/timestep&gt;</sgmltag>

... the next timestep ...

<sgmltag>&lt;/sumo-netstate&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

        <para>The values have the following meaning:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para><sgmltag>pos</sgmltag>: The position of the vehicle at the

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>As you may imagine, this output is very verbose. His main
        disadvantage is the size of the generated file. It's very easy to
        generate files that are several GB large within some minutes. It is of
        course possible to write some nice tools that parse the file (using a
        SAX-parser) and generate some meaningful information, but we do not
        know anyone who has made this. Another problem is that the
        simulation's execution speed of course breaks down when such an amount
        of data must be written.</para>

        <para>Normally, all lanes are written, even if there is no vehicle on
        them. You can change this behaviour using the boolean switch
        <option>--dump-empty-edges</option>. In this case, only those edges
        and lanes will be written that contain vehicles.</para>

        <title>Aggregated Lane/Edge States (Edge/Lane-Dumps)</title>

        <para>This output is far more feasible than the network dump. There
        are two different types of these files, one is edge-based, the other
        lane-based. Both describe the situation on all of the network's
        edges/lanes in terms of traffic science by giving macroscopic values
        such as the mean vehicle speed, the mean density, etc.</para>

        <para>In the following, it is described how both outputs are generated
        and which values they contain. Then, the meanings of the values are
        given as well as a description of intervals. At last, some additional
        possibilities to constraint the outputs are given.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Some people find the number of information within the

          <title>Edge-Based Network States</title>

          <para>To force SUMO to generate edge-based state dumps, you have to
          use two command line options: a) <option>--dump-basename
          <replaceable>&lt;PATH_AND_FILE_PREFIX&gt;</replaceable></option>
          describes where to write the dumps to and how the begin of the file
          name is, b) <option>--dump-intervals
          <replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL&gt;</replaceable>[,<replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL&gt;</replaceable>]*</option>
          describes over what time the values shall be collected and
          aggregated ("interval length"). Each aggregation interval is written
          into an own, single file. The file name is made up from the base
          name and the aggregation interval:
          <filename><replaceable>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</replaceable> =
          <replaceable>&lt;PATH_AND_FILE_PREFIX&gt;</replaceable>_<replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL&gt;</replaceable>.xml</filename>.
          An example: <option>--dump-basename=./output/lanedump
          --dump-intervals=300,600</option> will build two files:

          <para>If you need only information about the network states during

          using the options <option>--dump-begins

          <option>--dump-ends
          <replaceable>&lt;TIME&gt;[,&lt;TIME&gt;]+</replaceable></option>.
          When at least one combination is given, dumps will be written only
          if an according begin/end-pair exists for the current time. This
          means, only those intervals will be saved for which
          dump-begins[x]&lt;=INTERVAL_END and dump-ends[x]&gt;=INTERVAL_BEGIN.
          All dumps will cover the complete simulation if the options
          <option>--dump-begins</option> and <option>--dump-ends</option> are
          not set.</para>

          <para>Normally, dumps also include information about streets/lanes
          that were not used within the interval. Values for speed and
          traveltime are in this case computed using the edges'/lanes' default

          this case, output will be generated every time the traffic light
          switches. To use this feature, simply replace the freq-attribute
          within the description of an e2-detector by the id of the traffic
          light that should steer it (use the attribute
          "<sgmltag>tl</sgmltag>" to specify the id):</para>

          link. To enable this, one has to add the name of the following

          <para>An emitter needs further information to know when, how many
          and what kind of vehicles shall be emitted. All this information
          must be written into
          <replaceable>&lt;DEFINITION_FILE&gt;</replaceable>. The easiest way
          to describe vehicle emissions herein is to list all of them
          explicitely:</para>

          <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;triggeredsource&gt;
   &lt;emit id="veh1" time="0" type="my_type" route="my_route" speed="13.9"/&gt;
   &lt;emit id="veh2" time="4" type="my_type" route="my_route" speed="13.9"/&gt;
   &lt;emit id="veh3" time="8" type="my_type" route="my_route" speed="13.9"/&gt;
&lt;/triggeredsource&gt;
</sgmltag></programlisting>

          <para>Using such a definition only would raise error because we have
          named the vehicle types and the routes but did not define them. We
          can either define them within another additional file or within a
          route file but we have to ensure that they're loaded before the
          emission definition is (see "<link
          linkend="user_chp06-file_load_order">Using the Files in a correct
          Way</link>" on loading order). Let's assume we have done it. In this
          case, using such a definition we would emit three vehicles, having
          the names "veh1", "veh2", and "veh3" as given within the id-field,
          all being of type "my_type". All vehicles use the same route,
          "my_route", and will start with a velocity of 0 at the simulation
          seconds 0, 4, and 8. To summarize, a vehicle emission within an
          Emitter definition is described as following: <sgmltag>&lt;emit
          [id="<replaceable>&lt;VEHICLE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"]
          [type="<replaceable>&lt;VEHICLE_TYPE&gt;</replaceable>"]
          time="<replaceable>&lt;EMISSION_TIME&gt;</replaceable>"
          [route="<replaceable>&lt;VEHICLE_ROUTE&gt;</replaceable>"]
          [speed="<replaceable>&lt;INITIAL_SPEED&gt;</replaceable>"]/&gt;</sgmltag>.
          The meanings of these values are:</para>

          <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
            <listitem>

          <para>As you can see, several of the fields are marked as optional.
          If no id is given, the id will be constructed automatically. The
          vehicle will then have a name made up from the emitter's id followed
          by the time step the vehicle shall be emitted at and a running
          number, all divided by a '_'
          ("<replaceable>&lt;EMITTER_ID&gt;</replaceable>_<replaceable>&lt;DEPART&gt;</replaceable>_<replaceable>&lt;RUNNING&gt;</replaceable>").
          Also, the emission speed is optional. If not given, the minimum of
          the maximum speed allowed on the lane and the vehicle's maximum
          velocity is used. If the emission time lies before the simulation
          begin, the vehicle will be discarded. The following sections
          describe how one can omit explicite attributes for vehicle type and
          route.</para>

        <sect3 id="user_chp06-vehicle_handling-emitter-routedist">
          <title>Describing Route Distributions</title>

          <para>To avoid computing and assigning a vehicle type and a route to
          each vehicle emission definition explicitely, you can define a
          probability distribution by which routes/types are chosen from a
          set. For the routes, you can do this as shown in the next
          example:</para>

          <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;triggeredsource&gt;
   &lt;routedistelem id="my_route1" probability=".2"/&gt;
   &lt;routedistelem id="my_route2" probability=".8"/&gt;

   &lt;emit id="veh1" time="0" type="my_type" speed="13.9"/&gt;
   &lt;emit id="veh2" time="4" type="my_type" speed="13.9"/&gt;
&lt;/triggeredsource&gt;
</sgmltag></programlisting>

          <para>Now, a random route is assigned to a vehicle, "my_route1" with
          a probability of .2, "my_route2" with a probability of .8. The
          probabilities are normed automatically, that means that you can also
          use numbers that do not sum to 1. Each occuring
          <sgmltag>routedistelem</sgmltag> will be added to the distribution
          (see also "<link

        <para>Vehicles must be informed that they must stop at a bus stop. The

        <filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;</replaceable>/data/examples/extended/busses1</filename>):</para>

    <sgmltag>&lt;/vehicle&gt;</sgmltag>
</programlisting>

        <para>What we have here is a vehicle named "0" being a "BUS". "BUS" is
        a referenced type declared earlier. The vehicle has an embedded route
        (written by hand in this case) and a list of stop places. Each stop
        place is described by two attributes, "<sgmltag>bus_stop</sgmltag>"
        and "<sgmltag>duration</sgmltag>" where "<sgmltag>bus_stop</sgmltag>"
        is the name of the bus stop the vehicle shall halt at and
        "<sgmltag>duration</sgmltag>" is the time the vehicle shall wait at
        the bus stop in seconds. Please remark that the order of bus stops the
        vehicle shall halt at must be correct.</para>

        <para>You may also let a vehicle stop at another position than a bus
        stop. The complete definition of a vehicle's stop is:
        <sgmltag>&lt;stop (
        bus_stop="<replaceable>&lt;BUS_STOP_ID&gt;</replaceable>" |
        lane="<replaceable>&lt;LANE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
        pos="<replaceable>&lt;POSITION_AT_LANE&gt;</replaceable>" )
        duration="<replaceable>&lt;HALTING_DURATION&gt;</replaceable>"/&gt;</sgmltag>.
        This means you can <emphasis>either</emphasis> use a bus stop
        <emphasis>or</emphasis> a lane position to define where a vehicle has
        to stop.</para>

        <para>One of the trigger objects that may be specified within an
        additional file allows the simulation of variable speed signs. The
        syntax for such an object is: <sgmltag>&lt;trigger

        This trigger is typed to be a vss by the combination of the values of
        the attributes <sgmltag>objecttype="lane"</sgmltag> and
        <sgmltag>attr="speed"</sgmltag>. Although no other combinations are
        implemented so far, this combination forces the simulation to change
        the attribute "speed" of a "lane"-object, exactly what vss do. Of
        course, the vehicles themselves do not override this maximum velocity
        what does not exactly represent the reality.</para>

        <para>You may have noticed that a file name must be supplied, called

        the schema above. This file must contain the information about when a
        certain speed shall be set onto the lane. This file has the following

        As you may see, rerouter may be placed on several edges, at least one
        edge is necessary. Furthermore, you may already define the probability

        <para>A rerouter may work in several different ways. Within a time

      <title>Using the Files in a correct Way</title>

      <para>You may have noticed that beside the networks, SUMO additionally
      reads route files and "additional" files. Most of the structures
      (detectors, actors, route definitions, vehicle type definitions, tls
      definitions, etc.) may be placed in both route files and additional
      files. On the low application level the difference between the two file
      types is the order of loading them.</para>

      <para>Normally, when the option <option>route-steps</option> is left to
      be not equal to zero, additional files are parsed first, in the order of
      their definition. This means if you set the option "<option>-a
      file1.add.xml;file2.add.xml</option>", at first
      "<filename>file1.add.xml</filename>" will be loaded, then
      "<filename>file2.ad..xml</filename>". Each file is read completely
      before the next file is parsed. This means that if you have some global
      routes and want to reference them by a changing set of vehicles, you
      should place these routes in a file which is loaded at first. After all
      additional files have been read, the route files are opened. Still, they
      are not read immediately but as soon as the simulation starts. Each of
      these files is read until a vehicle emission occures which is beyond the
      current time step + time defined in <option>route-steps</option>. Here,
      all route files are parsed in the order they occured within the call,
      too.</para>

      <para>The things change a little bit if the option
      <option>route-steps</option> is set to zero. In this case, the route
      files are parsed as first, BEFORE the simulation starts. They also will
      be parsed completely before the additional files are parsed. If you need
      your additional files to be parsed at first, either use a
      <option>route-steps</option> value not equal to zero or place your
      additional files at the begin of the route-files list.</para>

        <title>Simulation of Accidents</title>

        <para>SUMO uses a collision-free traffic flow model. So if everything
        works as it should, no accidents should occure. If you want to model
        an accident you have the following possibilities:</para>

            <para>Use variable speed signs to set a lane's maximum velocity

        <para>Still, in some cases, for example if you insert a tls with no
        yellow phase, collisions may occure within the simulation. Earlier
        versions of <application>SUMO</application> reported an error in such
        cases and quit. We decided to change this behaviour. By now, the
        simulation reports a warning in such cases and tries to solve the
        problem internally, either by changing the position of the last car or
        - if this does not work because the lane the accident happened at is
        full - by removing one of the cars and trying to reinsert it as soon
        as possible. You still may force the simulation to quit as soon an
        "accident" happens using the option
        <option>--quit-on-accident</option>.</para>

    <para>The simulation-GUI (graphical user interface) is basically a wrapper
    around the command line simulation. The normal procedure is to start the
    gui-version like any other Window-based application (double-click on it)
    and to load a simulation's description specified using a "normal"
    configuration-file as used by the simulation's command line version. After
    loading it - what may dure a longer time if the network is large or the
    simulation is forced to load many routes at once - the network shall
    appear. Your application should then look like displayed below (with your
    own network, of course).</para>

    manoeuvre within the network pressing one of the mouse buttons and moving
    the mouse. When moving the mouse within the window with the left button

    the mouse is moved with the right button pressed, you change the scale the

    <title>Tips, Tricks and Tools</title>

    <para>We want to supply some additional information that did not fit into
    the descriptions within the previous chapters. The next chapters are
    possibly the most interesting ones of this document as they describe some
    possibilities to ease the work.</para>

    <sect1 id="user_chp08-configs">
      <title>Using Configuration Files</title>

      <para>Most simulations have to be executed more than only one time.
      Furthermore, some experiments require the execution of similar, slightly
      different settings, for example the same network with a different route
      set. To avoid retyping of all parameter at the input line, all of the
      main applications can be fed with a configuration file. This
      configuration file contains the values the user normally would give to
      the program at the command line. For example, instead of typing</para>

      <screen>duarouter --cell=<replaceable>myCellFile</replaceable> --net=<replaceable>mySUMONet.net.xml</replaceable> --output-file=<replaceable>MySUMORoutes.rou.xml</replaceable> \
   -b <replaceable>0</replaceable> -e <replaceable>3600</replaceable></screen>

      <para>you can start the router with a configuration file only:</para>

      <screen>duarouter -c=<replaceable>myConfig.rou.cfg</replaceable></screen>

      <para>The <option>-c <replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> -
      option may be passed to all of the package's main applications.</para>

      <para>Of course, you have to build the configuration file
      "<filename>myConfig.rou.cfg</filename>" first. You can find templates
      for configuration files within the data/cfg_templates - folder and all
      examples coming with the release contain configuration files,
      too.</para>

      <para>A configuration file is a simple XML-file in which each of the
      command line parameters is represented as a XML-element with the
      parameter's value being given as text between the begin and end tag of
      this parameter. So if you want to set a parameter "foo" to the value
      "bar" within your configuration file, write
      <sgmltag>&lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;foo/&gt;</sgmltag> into the configuration
      file. Do not forget that each XML-file has to have a root element, so
      that the whole configuration file would look like this:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;configuration&gt;
   <sgmltag>&lt;foo&gt;</sgmltag>bar<sgmltag>&lt;foo/&gt;</sgmltag>
<sgmltag>&lt;/configuration&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

      <para>Between the starting at the ending tag, any type of values may be
      set, use a 'x' to mark boolean values as set. If a parameter allows a
      set of values (normally separated by a ';'), you have to use a single
      element and embed these value into it as you would on command line. A
      different approach will maybe be invented in future. You can find the
      templates for each of the package's application's configuration files
      within the folder
      "<filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;</replaceable>/data/cfg_templates</filename>".</para>

        <title>Polygon Conversion</title>

        <para>Since version 0.9.5 a further application was added to the
        suite: <application>POLYCONVERT</application>, a tool which allows you
        to convert polygons from Elmar's format into a description that may be
        used by SUMO. As the offset that was applied to the network during the
        conversion using <application>NETCONVERT</application> is needed, one
        has to supply the network name using <option>--net-file
        <replaceable>&lt;SUMO_NET&gt;</replaceable></option>
        (<option>--net</option> or <option>-n</option> for short).
        Additionally the name of the file that contains the polygons to import
        must be given using <option>--elmar
        <replaceable>&lt;ELMAR_POLYGON_FILE&gt;</replaceable></option>. The
        conversion from geocoordinates to cartesian is recommended, initiated
        using <option>--use-projection</option> and defined using
        <option>--proj
        <replaceable>&lt;PROJ_DEFINITION&gt;</replaceable></option> (see also
        "<link linkend="user_chp04-further_options-geocoordinates">Converting
        from Geocoordinates</link>").</para>

        <para>Defaults for the polygon's color and layer as well as a name
        prefix and the name of the type to assign can be given using the
        options <option>--color
        <replaceable>&lt;COLORDEF&gt;</replaceable></option>, <option>--layer
        <replaceable>&lt;LAYER_NO&gt;</replaceable></option>, <option>--prefix
        <replaceable>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</replaceable></option>, and <option>--type
        <replaceable>&lt;TYPENAME&gt;</replaceable></option>, respectively. As
        some inputs may contain different polygon types, you can also use a
        file which contains a type map which defines which values shall be set
        in dependance to the type. A single entry for this typemap should look
        like this: <sgmltag>&lt;polytype
        id="<replaceable>&lt;PREVIOUS_NAME&gt;</replaceable>"
        name="<replaceable>&lt;NEW_NAME&gt;</replaceable>"
        color="<replaceable>&lt;COLORDEF&gt;</replaceable>"

        layer="<replaceable>&lt;LAYER_NO&gt;</replaceable>"

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>An example type-map for Elmar's polygons can be found in
        <filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;</replaceable>/data/</filename>add/elmar_type_map.xml.
        It is given to POLYCONVERT using the <option>--typemap
        <replaceable>&lt;TYPEMAP_FILE&gt;</replaceable></option>
        option.</para>

        <para>Since version 0.9.6, <application>POLYCONVERT</application> can
        also import single points of interest from Elmar's pointcollection
        files. To import such a file use the option <option>--elmar-points
        <replaceable>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</replaceable></option>, where
        <option><replaceable>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</replaceable></option> is the
        name of the file to import. You can use a type map in this case, too.
        In this case, the attribute "filled" will be ignored, all other
        attributes are processed as in the case of importing polygons.</para>

        <para>Also since this version, <application>POLYCONVERT</application>
        can import polygons and pois from Visum-networks. The options herefore
        are <option>--visum
        <replaceable>&lt;VISUM_NET&gt;</replaceable></option> and
        <option>--visum-points
        <replaceable>&lt;VISUM_NET&gt;</replaceable></option>. In the first
        case, polygons from "BEZIRK" and "GEBIET" are imported, in the second
        "POI". "POIKATEGORIE" is parsed in the second steps and the values
        stored herein are used as type names; for "BEZIRK", the type name
        "district" is used, "area" for "GEBIET". These type names may be
        references in the type map file.</para>

        <para>In some cases, it is wished not to import all polygons/pois. You
        can constrain which polygons/pois shall be written using the by
        assigning the attribute "<sgmltag>discard</sgmltag>" to certain types
        of polygons(pois within the type-map. You can also prune those
        polygons/pois that are not lying within a certain bounding box. This
        is done by calling <application>POLYCONVERT</application> with the
        option <option>--prune.boundary
        <replaceable>&lt;BOUNDARY&gt;</replaceable></option>.
        <option><replaceable>&lt;BOUNDARY&gt;</replaceable></option> is in
        this case the bounding box in which a polygon/poi must be located in
        order to be written into the output. It is a list of four floats,
        separated using ',' that describe the minimum x-value, the minimum
        y-value, the maximum x-value, and the maximum y-value of the bounding
        box. If one wishes to use the network's dimensions as the bounding
        box, he/she can do this using the option
        <option>--prune.on-net</option>. Additionally, one can supply offsets
        to the network's dimensions using <option>--prune.on-net.offsets
        <replaceable>&lt;BOUNDARY&gt;</replaceable></option>.</para>

          <para>All these three examples generate 100 vehicles which all have
          the same route. In "trips2routes" each vehicle has an own route.
          They all are the same, only the vehicles' ids differ.
          "trips2routes_repetition" generates one vehicle but which is
          duplicated within the simulation 100 times. "flows2routes" generates
          100 vehicles and routes using a flow definition. The vehicles differ
          from those generated by "trips2routes" only by their ids.</para>
