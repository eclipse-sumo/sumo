      <title>What is SUMO?</title>

      <para>SUMO is a traffic simulation tool. It was primarily designed for
      urban street networks, but it may also be used for highway traffic
      simulations. In the near future it will be extended to model other
      transit modes simultaneously with ordinary car traffic.</para>

    <sect1 id="user_chp01-opensource">
      <title>Why open source?</title>

      <para>Two thoughts stood behind the release of the package as open
      source. At first the fact that every traffic research organisation is
      forced to implement an own simulation package; some people are
      interested in traffic light optimisation, other try to find mistakes
      made during the design of a road network. Both need some kind of a
      simulation package and have to implement a framework containing input
      and output functions and other things from scratch. So the first idea
      was to give them a basic framework - containing all needed methods for a
      simulation - they can put own ideas into. The second idea is to supply a
      common test bed for models, especially car models, to the community to
      make them comparable. Due to different architectures of traffic
      simulations such comparisons on a wide scale are not possible by
      now.</para>

      <title>Installing SUMO</title>

      <para>From version 0.8 on, we want not only supply the sources, but also
      the compiled binaries at least for MS Windows. We have abandonned the
      idea of releasing binaries for Linux due to large variety of the target
      systems.</para>

      <para>If you are a Windows user, you should decide whether you primary
      want to use the software only or also extend it. In the first case, you
      should download the binaries. All needed libraries will be included and
      - if necessary - a script should guide you through the installation
      process. In the latter case, please download the source distribution and
      compile it for your own. The description of the building process is
      found within a separate document located <ulink
      url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/dev_chp02.html">here</ulink>. If
      you have built the package on a system not included within our binary
      distribution, please let us know and send it to us, so that we can
      include it into the pages.</para>

      <para>There are also some scripts available, located within the
      <filename>tools</filename>-folder. To execute them you'll need to have
      <ulink url="http://www.python.org/">python</ulink> and/or <ulink

      <para>All examples are located within the
      <filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;</replaceable>/data</filename> -
      folder and its subfolders. All examples come with a configuration-file
      for network building and running the simulation and some contain also a
      configuration-file for building the routes. Read chapter "<ulink
      url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/gen/user_chp08.shtml#user_chp08-configs">Using
      Configuration Files</ulink>" for further information on how to use
      configuration files. Some of the examples also contain .bat-files which
      contain the call to the applications so you may take a look into these
      files to see how the applications are run. Please remark that almost all
      applications are command line tools, what means that no window pops up
      if you start it, you have to open a shell window first.</para>

      <para>You may also run the examples in batch mode. For this, change into
      the folder you have extracted the package into
      (<filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;</replaceable></filename>),
      build the project if necessary (not needed if you have downloaded the
      binaries) and go further to the "<filename>tools</filename>"-folder. You

        <title>Simulation types</title>

        <para>SUMO is a microscopic, space continuous and time discrete
        traffic simulation.</para>

        <para>In traffic research four classes of models are distinguished
        according to the level of detail of the simulation. In
        <emphasis>macroscopic</emphasis> models traffic flow is the basic
        entity. <emphasis>Microscopic</emphasis> models simulate the movement
        of every single vehicle on the street, mostly assuming that the
        behaviour of the vehicle depends on both, the vehicle's physical
        abilities to move and the driver's controlling behaviour (see <ulink
        url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/bibliography.shtml#ChowdhurySantenSchadschneider2000">[Chowdhury,
        Santen, Schadschneider, 2000]</ulink>). Within SUMO, the microscopic
        model developed by Stefan Krauß is used (see <ulink
        url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/bibliography.shtml#Krauss1998_1">[Krauss1998_1]</ulink>,
        <ulink
        url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/bibliography.shtml#Krauss1998_2">[Krauss1998_2]</ulink>).
        <emphasis>Mesoscopic</emphasis> simulations are located at the
        boundary between microscopic and macroscopic ones. Herein, vehicle
        movement is mostly simulated using queue approaches and single
        vehicles are moved between such queues.
        <emphasis>Sub-microscopic</emphasis> models regard single vehicles
        like microscopic but extend them by dividing them into further
        substructures, which describe the engine's rotation speed in relation
        to the vehicle's speed or the driver's preferred gear switching
        actions, for instance. This allows more detailed computations compared
        to simple microscopic simulations. However, sub-microscopic models
        require large computation times. This restrains the size of the
        networks to be simulated.</para>

        <figure>
          <title>The different simulation granularities; from left to right:
          macroscopic, microscopic, sub-microscopic (within the circle:
          mesoscopic)</title>

        <para>Within a space-continuous simulation each vehicle has a certain
        position described by a floating-point number. In contrast,
        space-discrete simulations are a special kind of cellular automata.
        They use cells and vehicles driving on the simulated streets "jump"
        from one cell to another.</para>

        <para>Almost every simulation package uses an own model for vehicle
        movement. Almost all models are so-called
        "<emphasis>car-following-models</emphasis>": the behaviour of the
        driver is herein meant to be dependent on his distance to the vehicle
        in front of him and of this vehicle's speed. Although SUMO is meant to
        be a test bed for such vehicle models, only one is implemented by now,
        which was developed by Stefan Krauß. Other obstacles such as traffic
        lights are of course considered herein, too.</para>

        <para>It seems obvious, that each driver is trying to use to shortest
        path through the network. But when all are trying to do this, some of
        the roads - mainly the arterial roads - would get congested and their
        benefit would sink. Solutions for this problem are known to traffic
        research as <emphasis>dynamic user assignment</emphasis>. For solving
        this, several approaches are available and SUMO uses the dynamic user
        assignment approach developed by Christian Gawron (see <ulink
        url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/bibliography.shtml#Gawron1998_1">[Gawron1998_1]</ulink>).</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="user_chp03-simulation_theory-needed_data">
        <title>Needed Data</title>

        <para>At first, you need the network the traffic to simulate takes
        place on. As SUMO is meant to work with large networks, we mainly
        concentrated our work on importing networks and the computation of
        further needed values. Due to this, no graphical editor for networks
        is available, yet. Beside information about a network's roads,
        information about traffic lights is needed.</para>

        <para>Further, you need information about the traffic demand. While
        most traffic simulation use a statistical distribution which is laid
        over the network, each vehicle within SUMO knows its route. Within
        this approach, the route is a list of edges to pass. Although this
        approach is more realistic, it also induces a large amount of data
        needed to describe the vehicle movements. By now, routes are not
        compressed within SUMO and so may be several MB large. We will
        possibly change this in future.</para>

      <title>Main Software Paradigms</title>

      <para>Two basic design goals are approached: the software shall be fast
      and it shall be portable. Due to this, the very first versions were
      developed to be run from the command line only - no graphical interface
      was supplied at first and all parameter had to be inserted by hand. This
      should increase the execution speed by leaving off slow visualisation.
      Also, due to these goals, the software was split into several parts.
      Each of them has a certain purpose and must be run individually. This is
      something that makes SUMO different to other simulation packages where
      the dynamical user assignment is made within the simulation itself, not
      via an external application like here. This split allows an easier
      extension of each of the applications within the package because each is
      smaller than a monolithic application doing everything. Also, it also
      allows the usage of faster data structures, each adjusted to the current
      purpose, instead of using complicated and ballast-loaded ones. Still,
      this makes the usage of SUMO a little bit uncomfortable in comparison to
      other simulation packages. As there are still other things to do, we are
      not thinking of a redesign towards an integrated approach by now.</para>

      the same as well as "<emphasis>edge</emphasis>" and

        <para>As you may notice, only the first node named "0", which is the

        each of both ends of a street needs an according node. This is not
        really necessary as you may see soon, but it eases the understanding
        of the concept: every edge (road) is a connection between two
        nodes.</para>

        <para>You should also know something about the coordinate system: the

        <title>Edges Descriptions</title>

        <para>Edges are described quite the same way as nodes, but possesses
        other parameter. Within the edges file, each description of a single
        edge looks like this: <sgmltag>&lt;edge
        id="<replaceable>&lt;STRING&gt;</replaceable>"
        (fromnode="<replaceable>&lt;NODE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
        tonode="<replaceable>&lt;NODE_ID&gt;</replaceable>" |
        xfrom="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"
        yfrom="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"
        xto="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"
        yto="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>")
        [(type="<replaceable>&lt;STRING&gt;</replaceable>" |
        nolanes="<replaceable>&lt;INT&gt;</replaceable>"
        speed="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"
        priority="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"
        length="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>")]
        [shape="<replaceable>&lt;2D_POINT&gt; </replaceable>[
        <replaceable>&lt;2D_POINT&gt;</replaceable>]*
        <replaceable>&lt;2D_POINT&gt;</replaceable>"]
        [spread_type="center"]/&gt;</sgmltag>.</para>

        <para>What does it mean? Every one who knows how XML-files look like
        should have noticed brackets ('(' and ')') and pipes ('|') within the
        definition and these characters are not allowed within XML... What we
        wanted to show which parameter is optional. So for the definition of
        the origin and the destination node, you can either give their names
        using <sgmltag>fromnode="<replaceable>&lt;NODE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
        tonode="<replaceable>&lt;NODE_ID&gt;</replaceable>" </sgmltag>or you
        give their positions using
        <sgmltag>xfrom="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"
        yfrom="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>
        xto="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"
        yto="<replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable>"</sgmltag>. In the
        second case, nodes will be build automatically at the given positions.
        Each edge is unidirectional and starts at the
        "<sgmltag>from</sgmltag>"-node and ends at the
        "<sgmltag>to</sgmltag>"-node. If a name of one of the nodes can not be
        dereferenced (because they have not been defined within the nodes
        file) an error is generated.</para>

        <para>For each edge, some further attributes should be supplied, being
        the number of lanes the edge has, the maximum speed allowed on the
        edge, the length the edge has (in meters) and a priority value. These
        values - beside the length in fact - may either be given for each edge
        using according attributes or you can omit them by giving the edge a
        "<sgmltag>type</sgmltag>". In this case, you should also write a
        type-file (see "<ulink url="#user_chp04-xml_descriptions-types">Types
        Descriptions</ulink>"). A type with this name should of course be
        within the generated type-file, otherwise an error is reported. Even
        if you supply a type, you can still override the type's values by
        supplying any of the parameter <sgmltag>nolanes</sgmltag>,
        <sgmltag>speed</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>priority</sgmltag>. You may also
        leave the edge parameter completely unset. In this case,
        default-values will be used and the edge will have a single lane, a
        priority of 0 (zero) and the maximum allowed speed on this edge will
        be 13.9m/s being around 50km/h. The length of this edge will be
        computed as the distance between the starting and the end
        point.</para>

        <para>As an edge may have a more complicated geometry, you may supply
        the edge's shape within the <sgmltag>shape</sgmltag> tag. If the
        length of the edge is not given otherwise, the distances of the shape
        elements will be summed.</para>

        <para>The information <sgmltag>spread_type="center" </sgmltag>forces
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> to spread lanes to both sides of
        the connection between the begin node and the end node or from the
        list of lines making up the shape. If not given, lanes are spread to
        right, as default.</para>

</programlisting>

        <para>Within this example, we have used explicit definitions of edges.
        An example for using types is described in the chapter "<ulink
        url="#user_chp04-xml_descriptions-types">Types
        Descriptions</ulink>".</para>

        <caution>
          <para>There are some constraints about the streets' ids. They must
          not contain any of the following characters: '_' (underline - used
          for lane ids), '[' and ']' (used for enumerations), ' ' (space -
          used as list divider), '*' (star, used as wildcard), ':' (used as
          marker for internal lanes).</para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="user_chp04-xml_descriptions-types">
        <title>Types Descriptions</title>

        <para>As mentioned, road types are meant to be used to ease the
        definition of edges. As described above, the description of an edge
        should include information about the number of lanes, the maximum
        speed allowed on this edge and the edge's priority. To avoid the
        explicit definition of each parameter for every edge, one can use road
        types, which encapsulate these parameter under a given name.</para>

        <para>The attributes of a type are of course exactly the same as for
        edges themselves:</para>

        <para><itemizedlist spacing="compact">

          </itemizedlist>The information about the nodes the edge starts and
        ends at is not given within the types' descriptions. They can only be
        set within the edge's attributes.</para>

        <para>An example of using types may be found in
        "<filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;</replaceable>/data/examples/netbuild/cross_usingtypes/</filename>".
        Instead of explicit parameter edges reference types:</para>

        <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;edges&gt;</sgmltag>

   <sgmltag>&lt;edge id="1fi" fromnode="1" tonode="m1" type="b"/&gt;</sgmltag>

   <sgmltag>&lt;edge id="4o" fromnode="0" tonode="4" type="c"/&gt;</sgmltag>

<sgmltag>&lt;/edges&gt;</sgmltag>
</programlisting>

        <para>and the according types file looks like this:</para>

        <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;types&gt;</sgmltag>

   <sgmltag>&lt;type id="a" priority="3" nolanes="3" speed="13.889"/&gt;</sgmltag>

   <sgmltag>&lt;type id="c" priority="1" nolanes="1" speed="11.111"/&gt;</sgmltag>

<sgmltag>&lt;/types&gt;</sgmltag>
</programlisting>

        <para>As you can see, we have joined the edges into three classes "a",
        "b", and "c" and have generated a description for each of these
        classes. Doing this, the generated net is similar to the one generated
        using the settings described above (example
        "<filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;</replaceable>/data/examples/netbuild/cross_notypes/</filename>"
        ).</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="user_chp04-xml_descriptions-connections">
        <title>Connection Descriptions</title>

        <para>If you have tried the version 0.7 you have possibly missed the
        possibility to specify the connections between the edges for yourself.
        This is now possible using a further file, the connections file. The
        connection file specifies which edges outgoing from a junction may be
        reached by a certain edge incoming into this junction and optionally
        also which lanes shall be used on both sides.</para>

        <para>If you only want to describe which edges may be reached from a
        certain edge, this definition could look something like this:
        <sgmltag>&lt;connection
        from="<replaceable>&lt;FROM_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
        to="<replaceable>&lt;T0_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"/&gt;</sgmltag>.
        This tells <application>NETCONVERT</application> not only that
        vehicles shall be allowed to drive from the edge named
        <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;FROM_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag> to
        the edge named
        <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;TO_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>, but
        also prohibits all movements to other edges from
        <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;FROM_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>,
        unless they are specified within this file. Let's repeat the
        parameters:</para>

        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
          <listitem>
            <para><sgmltag>from</sgmltag>: The name of the edge the vehicles
            leave</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><sgmltag>to</sgmltag>: The name of the edge the vehicles may
            reach when leaving "from"</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>When using this kind of input,
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> will compute which lanes shall
        be used if any of the connected edges has more than one lane.</para>

        <para>If you also want to override this computation and set the lanes
        by hand, use the following: <sgmltag>&lt;connection
        from="&lt;FROM_EDGE_ID&gt;" to="&lt;T0_EDGE_ID&gt;"
        lane="&lt;INT_1&gt;:&lt;INT_2&gt;"/&gt;</sgmltag>. Here, a connection
        from the edge's
        "<sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;FROM_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>"
        lane with the number
        <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;INT_1&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag> is build
        to the lane
        <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;INT_2&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag> of the
        edge
        "<sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;TO_EDGE_ID</replaceable>&gt;</sgmltag>".
        Lanes are counted from the right (outer) to the left (inner) side of
        the road beginning with 0. Again the parameter:</para>

        <para><itemizedlist spacing="compact">
            <listitem>

          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>There are two examples within the distribution. Both use the
        nodes and edges descriptions from the example located in
        "<filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;</replaceable>/data/examples/netbuild/cross_notypes/</filename>".
        The junction in the center of this example looks like shown within the
        next figure. We will now call it the "unconstrained network" because
        all connections and turnarounds are computed using the default
        values.</para>

        shows what happens when one uses connections to limit the number of
        reachable edges. To do this we built a connections file where we say
        that the horizontal edges ("1si" and "2si") have only connections to
        the edges right to them and the edge in straight direction. The file
        looks like this:</para>

        <para>As you may see in the next picture, the horizontal edges within

        we additionally describe which lanes shall be connected. The according

        <para>After you have generated the files you need being at least the
        edges and the nodes-files and optionally also a type and/or a
        connections file you should run <application>NETCONVERT</application>
        to build the network. The call should look like:</para>

        <screen>netconvert --xml-nodes-files=MyNodes.nod.xml --xml-edge-files=MyEdges.edg.xml \
   --output-file=MySUMONet.net.xml</screen>

        <para>if you only use edges and nodes. Types and connections may be

        <para>Maybe your edge definitions are incomplete or buggy. If you
        still want to import your network, you can try passing
        "<option>--omit-corrupt-edges</option>" to

        not defined properly, are omitted, but
        <application>NETCONVERT</application> tries to build the network

        <para>Each of the maps we've got from NavTech, being encoded in the
        ArcView database format, describes an area of a single state or
        federal state. This is much too large for our purposes, as we are
        mainly interested in urban traffic. In fact, we have not tried out
        which resources are needed to perform the simulation of a single
        German federal state with SUMO, although this should be possible at
        all. Due to this, one has at first to extract an area of interest. Our
        first approaches to do this by using postal numbers is not as
        sophisticated as firstly though to be: some interesting parts of the
        cities, above all major highways do not belong to the postal code area
        of the regarded city (Magdeburg and Munich within this test).</para>

        <title>Importing Cell/Fastlane-networks</title>

        <para>FastLane, developed at the <ulink
        url="http://www.zaik.uni-koeln.de/">ZAIK</ulink>, is a mesoscopic
        traffic simulation. The network description consists of a file
        containing edges and a second one containing nodes. Due to this, you
        need to supply two values as input parameter and the call looks like
        this:</para>

        <screen>netconvert --cell-nodes=<replaceable>&lt;CELL_NODE_FILE&gt;</replaceable> --cell-edges=<replaceable>&lt;CELL_EDGE_FILE&gt;</replaceable> \
   --output-file=<replaceable>MySUMOFile.net.xml</replaceable></screen>

        <para>Of course, both files must belong to the same network. As
        FastLane is a mesoscopic simulation, sometime the number of an edge's
        lanes is not given. Instead, FastLane uses the capacity. In such
        cases, the number of lanes is computed roughly using the edge's
        capacity. We assume a linear dependency for this, currently, although
        this may not be the best solution. So, the number of lanes is computed
        as EDGE_CAPACITY/NORM. You may change the norm from its default of
        20000 using the option <option>--capacity-norm</option>.</para>

        <title>Importing VISSIM-networks</title>

        <para>Although Vissim is a microscopic simulation as SUMO is, it
        follows a completely different concept of modelling traffic. Due to
        this, the import is quite clumsy and may not work with all networks.
        Also, we have to insert additional edges into our networks to simulate
        the Vissim-parking places, originally being nodes, which we do not
        have. An usage example could be this one:</para>

        <screen>netconvert --vissim=<replaceable>&lt;VISSIM_FILE&gt;</replaceable> --output-file=<replaceable>MySUMOFile.net.xml</replaceable></screen>

        <para>Vissim-networks do possibly not contain explicit definitions of
        an edge's speed. We have to propagate once set velocities, but even
        then some edges' speeds may not be defined. The option
        "<option>--vissim-default-speed</option>" may change the default speed
        used in the case an edge's speed is not defined. The default value for
        this parameter is 13.89m/s, being around 50km/h. The second parameter
        "<option>--vissim-speed-norm</option>" describes the factor to
        multiply a described flows maximum velocity to gain the velocity to
        use. The default value is 1.</para>

        <para>Furthermore, as we have to use geometrical heuristics, a further
        factor steers the process of converting Vissim-networks: simply
        spoken, "<option>--vissim-offset</option>" holds the information how
        near two nodes must be (in meters) to be joined.</para>

        <para>During import, different actions must be done which may yield in
        some loss of data and may be watched in part by setting the verbose
        option. The additional warnings the import of Vissim-networks
        generates will be described in a further document.</para>

        mostly no meaning (maybe besides the additional possibility to make a
        U-turn) and may be removed. The removal of such nodes increases the
        simulation speed due to a smaller number of edges to process during

        <title>Importing Networks without Traffic Light Logics</title>

        <para>Some of the supported network formats - Visum, Vissim and
        Artemis, supply information about the logic of the traffic lights. The
        others do not. Due to this, we have to compute the traffic lights by
        our own. Doing this, we do not only have to compute the plans, but of
        course also, on which junction traffic lights are positioned. There
        are several options steering this procedure. At first, you have to
        tell
        <application>NETCONVERT</application>/<application>NETGEN</application>
        that you wish him to guess positions of traffic lights. This is done
        using the "<option>--guess-tls</option>"-option. Then, you have the
        possibility to describe the junctions at which you think a tls shall
        be placed using description of incoming and outgoing edges:
        "<option>--tls-guess.no-incoming-min</option>",
        "<option>--tls-guess.no-incoming-max</option>",
        "<option>--tls-guess.no-outgoing-min</option>" and
        "<option>--tls-guess.no-outgoing-max</option>" constraint the building
        of a tls by the number of the lanes incoming/outgoing edges have. All
        these four options require an int as parameter. Furthermore, you may
        constraint the junctions by giving the minimum/maximum of allowed
        speed on edges that participate:
        "<option>--tls-guess.min-incoming-speed</option>",
        "<option>--tls-guess.max-incoming-speed</option>",
        "<option>--tls-guess.min-outgoing-speed</option>", and
        "<option>--tls-guess.max-outgoing-speed</option>".</para>

        <caution>
          <para>No, we do not have a validated set of these option's settings,
          yet.</para>
        </caution>

        <para>You may also set junctions as tls-controlled using
        "<option>--explicite-tls</option>" or as uncontrolled using
        "<option>--explicite-no-tls</option>". Both options assume to get a
        list of node names divided by ';' as parameter. The behaviour when a
        node is in both lists is undefined.</para>

        <para>Normally, only one traffic lights logic (phases definition) is
        computed per a traffic lights controlled junction, but the algorithm
        we use is able to compute several logics. To force the computation of
        all possible logics, use "<option>--all-logics</option>". Remind, that
        all logics will be written to the network file and that we have no
        tools for further procesing of these logics.</para>

        <para>During the computation of tls-logics among other information we
        have to guess the duration of the phases. The options
        "<option>--traffic-light-green</option>" and
        "<option>--traffic-light-yellow</option>" allow you to give the
        durations of green and yellow lights. Both options assume the duration
        in s as an int as parameter. The duration of having red is dependant
        to the number of other phases and their green and yellow phase
        durations. The green phase length has a default of 20s, yellow lights
        are - if no value is set for this option - computed using the
        "<option>--min-decel</option>" - value described below.</para>

        <para>One has to remind one thing: dead times are necessary to avoid
        collisions of vehicles which do not manage to break as they are too
        near to the traffic light when it switches to red. This time may be
        computed, and is, but depends on the maximum deceleration possibility
        of the vehicles used. As this parameter is not known to the network
        builder at all - the vehicle types are supported to the simulation
        only - the option "<option>--min-decel</option>" (or
        <option>-D</option> for short) is used to set the minimum deceleration
        of vehicles. The default is 3.0 in m/s^2.</para>

        <para>There is no possibility to compute or estimate green light
        districts, yet. You have only the options to shift the computed phases
        by half of their duration or by a quarter of their duration. The
        options for this are: "<option>--tl-logics.half-offset</option>" and
        "<option>--tl-logics.quarter-offset</option>". Both options assume to
        get a list of node names divided by ';' as parameter. The behaviour
        when a node is in both lists or if the node is not meant to be
        controlled by a tls is undefined.</para>

        <para>Most of the imported network descriptions do not have

        <application>NETCONVERT</application> to guess where on- and off-ramps
        shall be build. To enable this, use the option
        "<option>--guess-ramps</option>". The algorithm assumes that an
        on-ramp shall be build on highway junctions with one incoming and one
        outgoing highway edge and one incoming minor edge and that an off-ramp
        shall be build on highway junctions with one incoming and one outgoing
        highway edge and one outgoing minor edge. You can contrain what a
        highway highway by giving its minimum speed of this edge using
        "<option>--ramp-guess.min-highway-speed</option>" and what a minor
        edge is by giving its maximum speed using
        "<option>--ramp-guess.max-ramp-speed</option>". Both options assume a
        float parameter being the speed. Furthermore,

      <title>Automatic Network Generation</title>

      <para><application>NETGEN</application> allows builds abstract networks.
      Three types of networks can be built. All of them are very easy, but may
      be used as examples. You are also greatly invited to extend the
      concepts. Available types are: grid-networks, spider-networks and
      random-networks.</para>

      <para>You always have to supply the name of the network to generate
      using <option>--output
      <replaceable>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</replaceable></option> or <option>-o
      <replaceable>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</replaceable></option> for short and the
      type of network you want to create. So, exactly one of the following
      switches must be supported: <option>--grid-net</option>,
      <option>--spider-net</option> or <option>--random-net</option>.</para>

      <para>While the type-dependent options are described within the next
      chapters, all types share some command line options. As all networks may
      possess junctions, you are able to set the default type of junctions to
      build using the <option>--default-junction-type</option>-option (or
      <option>-j</option> for short). The following junction types are allowed
      in accordance to the junction types currently known by the simulation:
      <option>priority</option>, <option>traffic_light</option>,
      <option>actuated</option>, <option>agentbased</option>.</para>

      <para><caution>
          <para><option>traffic_light</option> will be mapped to "static"
          within the generated network.</para>
        </caution></para>

      <para>Further, you can specify the default street type by using the same
      options as in the netconvert-application.</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Grid-like Networks</title>

        <para>You are able to describe how many junctions in x- and in
        y-direction you want to be build and how far from each other they
        should be. The parameter for the number of junctions are
        <option>--grid-x-number</option> and <option>--grid-y-number</option>,
        the ones for the distance between the junctions
        <option>--grid-x-length</option> and <option>--grid-y-length</option>.
        If you want to build networks which have the same values for both
        axes, use <option>--grid-number</option> and
        <option>--grid-length</option>. The lengths are given in
        meters.</para>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>After having your network converted into the SUMO-format, you
      could take a look at it using the gui-version of the simulation, but no
      cars would be driving around. You still need some kind of description
      about the vehicles. If you are importing data from other simulation
      packages, they normally bring own route definitions you can use. In case
      of using ArcView- or own data or in other cases where you do not have
      the vehicle movements at all, you have to generate them by your own.
      From now on we will use the following nomenclature: A
      <emphasis>trip</emphasis> is a vehicle movement from one place to
      another defined by the starting edge (street), the destination edge, and
      the departure time. A <emphasis>route</emphasis> is an expanded trip,
      that means, that a route definition contains no only the first and the
      last edge, but all edges the vehicle will pass. There are several ways
      to generate routes for SUMO:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>using trip definitions</para>

          <para>As described above, each trip consists at least of the
          starting and the ending edge and the departure time (see Chapter
          "<ulink url="#user_chp05-explicite-trips">Using Trip
          Definitions</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>using flow definitions</para>

          <para>This is mostly the same approach as using trip definitions,
          but you may join several vehicles having the same trips using this
          method (see Chapter "<ulink url="#user_chp05-explicite-flows">Using
          Flow Definitions</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>using flow definitions and turning ratios</para>

          <para>You may also leave out the destination edges for flows and use
          turning ratios at junctions instead (see Chapter "<ulink
          url="#user_chp05-own_routes-jtr">Using the Junction Turning Ratio -
          Router</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>using OD-matrices</para>

          <para>OD-matrices have to be converted to trips first (see Chapter
          "<ulink url="#user_chp05-od2trips">Using OD2TRIPS</ulink>"), then
          from trips to routes (see Chapter "<ulink
          url="#user_chp05-explicite-trips">Using Trip
          Definitions</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>by hand</para>

          <para>You can of course generate route files by hand.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>using random routes</para>

          <para>This is fast way to fill the simulation with life, but
          definitely a very inaccurate one (see Chapter "<ulink
          url="#user_chp05-own_routes-random">Generating random
          Routes</ulink>").</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>by importing available routes (see Chapter "<ulink
          url="#user_chp05-import_routes">Importing Routes from other
          Simulations</ulink>")</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>By now, the SUMO-package contains three applications for
      processing routes. <application>DUAROUTER</application> is responsible
      for importing routes from other simulation packages and for computing
      routes using the shortest-path algorithm by Dijkstra.
      <application>JTRROUTER</application> may be used if you want to model
      traffic statistically, using flows and turning percentages at junctions.
      <application>OD2TRIPS</application> helps you to convert OD-matrices
      (origin/destination-matrices) into trips. Within the next chapters, at
      first the mandatory arguments are described, then we will show how each
      of the possible methods of generating routes from scratch can be used.
      In the following, importing routes and additional options are given
      followed by a small overview.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="user_chp05-common">
      <title>Common, mandatory Values</title>

      <para>Independent to what you are doing, you always have to supply the
      network using the <option>--net-file</option> (or <option>--net</option>
      or <option>-n</option> for short) option. Additionally, you should let
      the application know which time interval is to be used. Route/trip/flow
      definiiotns will be imported within the interval given by the options
      <option>--begin</option> (<option>-b</option>) and
      <option>--end</option> (<option>-e</option>). Definitions with departure
      time earlier than the one specified by <option>--begin</option> or later
      than those specified by <option>--end</option> will be discarded. If you
      do not give a value for the begin / end time step the defaults 0 and
      86400 (one day) will be used, respectively.</para>

      <title>Building own Routes from Scratch</title>

      <para>You have either the possibility to generate completely random
      routes or to exactly describe what you want and pass this information to
      <application>DUAROUTER</application> or
      <application>JTRROUTER</application>, which then expand your
      descriptions to routes. As result, a routes file is normally generated
      which you may use within your simulation.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>You have to know that each route should consist of at least
        three edges! On the first, the vehicle will be emitted. As soon as it
        reaches <emphasis>the begin</emphasis> of the last, it will be removed
        from the network. So to see the vehicle running, you should at least
        have one edge in between!</para>
      </caution>

      <sect2 id="user_chp05-explicit">
        <title>Generating own, explicit Routes</title>

        <para>There are two possibilities to describe own routes. The first
        one id the usage of trip definitions, the second one the usage of flow
        descriptions. Trip definitions describe the movement of a single
        vehicle giving the departure time, and both the origin and the
        destination via their edge-id. Flow descriptions use these values to,
        but instead of describing only one vehicle, the description is used
        for a defined number of vehicles to be emitted within a described
        interval. Due to this, instead of the departure time, the period's
        begin and end times must be supplied and the number of vehicles to
        emit within this interval.</para>

        <sect3 id="user_chp05-explicite-trips">
          <title>Using Trip Definitions</title>

          <para>Trip definitions that can be laid into the network may be
          supplied to the router using an XML-file. The syntax of a single
          trip definition is: <sgmltag>&lt;tripdef
          id="<replaceable>&lt;ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          depart="<replaceable>&lt;TIME&gt;</replaceable>"
          from="<replaceable>&lt;ORIGIN_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"

          repno="<replaceable>&lt;INT&gt;</replaceable>"]
          [color="<replaceable>&lt;COLOR&gt;</replaceable>"]/&gt;</sgmltag>.
          You have to supply the edge the trip starts at (origin), the edge
          the trip ends at (destination) and the departure time at least. If
          the type is not given, a default ("SUMO_DEFAULT_TYPE") will be used
          and stored within the routes-file. If the attribute
          <sgmltag>period</sgmltag> is given, not only one vehicle will use
          the route, but every n seconds (where n is the number defined in
          period), a vehicle using this route will be emitted. The number of
          vehicles to emit using this route may be additionally constrained
          using <sgmltag>repno</sgmltag>. Otherwise, it is unlimited.</para>

          <title>Using Flow Definitions</title>

          <para>Flow amounts share most of the parameter with trip
          definitions. The syntax is: <sgmltag>&lt;flow
          id="<replaceable>&lt;ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          from="<replaceable>&lt;ORIGIN_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          to="<replaceable>&lt;DESTINATION_EDGE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
          begin="<replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL_BEGIN&gt;</replaceable>"
          end="<replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL_END&gt;</replaceable>"
          no="<replaceable>&lt;VEHICLES_TO_EMIT&gt;</replaceable>"
          [type="<replaceable>&lt;VEHICLE_TYPE&gt;</replaceable>"]
          [color="<replaceable>&lt;COLOR&gt;</replaceable>"]/&gt;</sgmltag>.
          Notice the following differences: the vehicle does not take a
          certain departure time as not only one vehicle is described by this
          parameter, but a set of, given within the attribute
          "<sgmltag>no</sgmltag>" (short for number). The departure times are
          spread uniformly within the time interval described by
          <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL_BEGIN&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>
          and
          <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL_END&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag>.
          All these three attributes must be integer values. The values
          "<sgmltag>period</sgmltag>" and "<sgmltag>repno</sgmltag>" are not
          used herein. Flow definitions can also be embedded into an interval
          tag. In this case one can (but does not have to) leave the tags
          "<sgmltag>begin</sgmltag>" and "<sgmltag>end</sgmltag>" out. So the
          following two snipples mean the same:</para>

          <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;flow id="0" from="edge0" to="edge1" begin="0" end="3600" no="100"/&gt;</sgmltag>

        <para>Random routes are the easiest, but also the most inaccurate way
        to feed your network with vehicle movements. Using the following call
        ro <application>DUAROUTER</application>:</para>

        <screen>duarouter --net=<replaceable>&lt;SUMO_NET&gt;</replaceable> -R <replaceable>&lt;FLOAT&gt;</replaceable> --output-file=<replaceable>MySUMORoutes.rou.xml</replaceable> \

   -b <replaceable>&lt;UINT&gt;</replaceable> -e <replaceable>&lt;UINT&gt;</replaceable></screen>

        <para>you will generate random routes for the time interval given by
        <option>-b(egin)</option> and <option>-e(nd)</option>. In each time
        step as many vehicles will be emitted into the network as given by the
        value of <option>-R</option> (<option>--random-per-second</option>).
        You can also supply values smaller than one. In this case, a single
        vehicle will be emitted each
        1/<option><replaceable>&lt;-R&gt;</replaceable></option> step.
        Example: <option>-R 0.25</option> generates a route description,
        which, when loaded, forces the simulation to emit a single vehicle
        each fourth time step. It is also possible to use this parameter in
        combination with other route definitions, for example supplying some
        fix routes and additionally generate random routes.</para>

        <para>Random routes are not the best way to generate routes. Take a
        look at the network displayed below. This network has two rural and
        many minor roads. Random routes are by now spread all over the network
        and each road is chosen to be the starting or the ending without
        respecting his function. Due to this, the network is filled over with
        cars, coming from and approaching directions, the normal traffic is
        not taking - the normal traffic would concentrate on rural
        roads.</para>

        <figure>

          behaviour due to the mixture of rural and minor roads</title>

        <para>There is also another problem with random routes: By definition,
        in 50% of the cases, the route starts in the opposite direction of the
        destination - on the wrong side of the road. This yields in a large
        amount of vehicles that want to turn back using the first possibility.
        This is of course also not common in the real world, especially not in
        areas as the one shown before. To avoid this, we remove the first and
        the last edge from the route per default when generating random
        routes.</para>

        <title>Using the Junction Turning Ratio - Router</title>

        <para>The following parameter must be supplied to the jtr-router: the
        network to route the vehicles through, the description of the turning
        ratios for the junctions (defaults may be used for this, too), and the
        descriptions of the flow.</para>

        <para>A call may look like this:</para>

        <screen>jtrrouter --flow-defs=<replaceable>&lt;FLOW_DEFS&gt;</replaceable> --turns=<replaceable>&lt;TURN_DEFINITIONS&gt;</replaceable> --net=<replaceable>&lt;SUMO_NET&gt;</replaceable> \
   --output-file=<replaceable>MySUMORoutes.rou.xml</replaceable> -b <replaceable>&lt;UINT&gt;</replaceable> -e <replaceable>&lt;UINT&gt;</replaceable></screen>

        <para>The definitions of the flow - may they be trip definitions or
        amount definitions - look like the ones for the dua-router with just a
        single difference: as the it is not known where the vehicle will leave
        the network as the route it uses is randomly computed, the destination
        parameter has no meaning for jtr-routing and so may be left off. A
        vehicle leaves the network as soon as it comes to a sink edge. As not
        all networks have sink edges set, one can support a list of edges to
        be declared as sinks using <option>--sinks
        <replaceable>&lt;EDGE_IDS&gt;</replaceable></option>.
        <option><replaceable>&lt;EDGE_IDS&gt;</replaceable></option> is in
        this case a list of edge ids separated using a ';'.</para>

        <para>To describe the turn definitions, one has to build a further
        file. Within this file, for each interval and each edge the list of
        percentages to use a certain follower is to be given. An
        example:</para>

        <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;turn-defs&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;interval begin="0" end="3600"&gt;</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag>&lt;fromedge id="myEdge0"&gt;</sgmltag>
         <sgmltag>&lt;toedge id="myEdge1" perc="0.2"/&gt;</sgmltag>
         <sgmltag>&lt;toedge id="myEdge2" perc="0.7"/&gt;</sgmltag>
         <sgmltag>&lt;toedge id="myEdge3" perc="0.1"/&gt;</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag>&lt;/fromedge&gt;</sgmltag>

      ... any other edges ...

   <sgmltag>&lt;/interval&gt;</sgmltag>

   ... some further intervals ...

<sgmltag>&lt;/turn-defs&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

        <para>The snippet defines that vehicles coming at the end of edge
        "myEdge0" within the time interval between 0s and 3600s will choose
        the edge "myEdge1" with a probability of 20%, "myEdge2" with a
        probability of 70% and "myEdge3" with a probability of 10%. The
        specification of such information is of course quite extensive and so
        the jtr-router is also able to read the turning ratios from a cvs
        file. The same information as above may be coded the following
        way:</para>

        <programlisting>interval;begin;end;from;to;split;
;0;3600;myEdge0;myEdge1;0.2;
;0;3600;myEdge0;myEdge2;0.7;
;0;3600;myEdge0;myEdge3;0.1;</programlisting>

        <para><caution>
            <para>Do not forget to give the order of the attributes in the
            first line of the file.</para>
          </caution></para>

        <para>Another possibility to save time on preparing the description is
        to use default values. The parameter <option>--turn-defaults</option>
        (<option>-T</option>)
        <option><replaceable>&lt;TURN_DEFAULTS&gt;</replaceable></option> can
        be used to describe the default ratios that will be used for all
        junctions for all time steps.
        <option><replaceable>&lt;TURN_DEFAULTS&gt;</replaceable></option> is a
        list of doubles, separated by a ';'. To achieve the same behaviour as
        in the example above, use <option>--turn-defaults=20;70;10</option>.
        The values will be applied to an edge's following edges beginning at
        the right edge (20%) and ending at the leftmost edge (10%). As the
        number of possible followers changes for different edges, the values
        are resampled to directional ratios for edges which number of
        following edges differs from the list of edges given within the
        turning defaults. Given <option>--turn-defaults=20;70;10</option> a
        vehicle using an edge that has two followers would use the follower to
        the right with 55% probability, the one to the left with 45%.</para>

        <para>As theoretically a route may get infinitely long when a vehicle
        is forced to take always the same direction, it is possible to limit
        the route's size using <option>max-edges-factor</option>. This factor,
        multiplied with the number of the used network's edges is the maximum
        number of edges a route may have. With the default of 2.0, a route may
        contain twice as many edges as the network has. We assume that for
        each network this number has to be chosen again.</para>

        <title>Importing FastLane-routes</title>

        <para>One of the main concepts of FastLane is the Dynamic User
        Assignment by Christian Gawron. As this mechanism is based on single
        vehicle routes, those are given for a FastLane simulation. The router
        module has only to convert routes from the FastLane- into the
        SUMO-representation. Do this using the following command:</para>

        <screen>duarouter --cell=<replaceable>&lt;CELL_FILE_NAME(NO_EXTENSION)&gt;</replaceable> --net=<replaceable>&lt;SUMO_NET&gt;</replaceable> \
   --output-file=<replaceable>MySUMORoutes.rou.xml</replaceable> -b <replaceable>&lt;UINT&gt;</replaceable> -e <replaceable>&lt;UINT&gt;</replaceable></screen>

        <para>If you are familiar with FastLane, you may have noticed that you
        have only to supply one file name while FastLane uses two files to
        describe the routes: one "*.driver" and one "*.rinfo" file. As both
        files have the same name and only the extension differs, you have to
        give the name without the extension. So if your files have the names
        "<filename>foo.drive</filename>r" and
        "<filename>foo.rinfo</filename>", write
        <option>--cell=foo</option>.</para>

        <para>FastLanes stores routes within a very large file what makes the
        process quite slow. If you want to speed it up for the future, you can
        tell SUMO-ROUTER to save some temporary files using
        <option>--save-cell-rindex</option>. A further file named
        "<replaceable>&lt;CELL_FILE_NAME&gt;</replaceable>.rindex" will be
        generated. It speeds up the processing by a factor of ten or
        so.</para>

        <para>As FastLane is portable, you may encounter files generated on a
        Windows-machine. Those files give some strange warnings, something
        that should not happen if you supply the right net. To avoid them, use
        the <option>--intel-cell</option> switch to tell
        <application>DUAROUTER</application> it has to turn the byte
        order.</para>

        <para>You can also decide whether the best, not the last route a
        driver took shall be used: set the switch
        <option>--no-last-cell</option> for this.</para>

      <sect2 id="user_chp05-import_routes-ptv">
        <title>Importing VISSIM und VISUM-routes</title>

        <para>While VISSIM holds the possibility to describe vehicle-based
        routes, too, our package contain only the second of VISSIM's route
        specification abilities, it shares with VISUM. This representation of
        vehicle movements is stored as origin-destination matrices which have
        to be translated into single vehicle movements first. This is done
        using the <application>OD2TRIPS</application> module. One has to pass
        the SUMO-network to use using the <option>--net-file</option>
        (<option>-n</option>) - option and the name of the output file using
        <option>--output-file</option> (<option>-o</option>). The generated
        output contains the single vehicle trips build from the OD-matrix.
        Also, one has to supply the file the origin/destination-matrix is
        described in. This is either a file with an ".fma" extension (other
        table types supported by VISSIM/VISUM are not supported) which holds a
        single OD-matrix or the VISSIM-simulation file itself (*.inp) which
        holds the names of the OD-files to use. The option that lets
        <application>OD2TRIPS</application> know about the file is
        <option>--od-file</option>. In the second case, the path to the
        matrices has to be supplied using the <option>--od-path</option> -
        option, too.</para>

        <para>Additionally, the first and the last time step to process may be
        given. If not given, the values stored within the parsed descriptions
        will be used. A further scaling factor may be used, too, which will be
        applied on the read streams. An example for parsing an OD-description
        that uses multiple matrices may be:</para>

        <para>After obtaining single vehicle trips using this approach they

      is the one in the middle of the network, even when considering the tls
      at the end of this road. But as soon as we insert many vehicles into the
      network, all trying to use this route, the edge located at the center
      soon gets full and vehicles need much more time than estimated to pass
      it. In fact, they need longer to pass this edge than if they would try

      <para>Within Christian Gawron's approach (see <ulink
      url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/docs/bibliography.shtml#Gawron1998_1">[Gawron1998_1]</ulink>),
      which we use, each driver has a list of routes. At the beginning, we
      build a single route for each driver being the shortest route within an
      empty network - not knowing how many vehicles will use this route. You
      may wonder that two files are built. The file you have named as output
      file and a further file having the additional extension ".alt". Within
      this second file route alternatives - the set of all routes the driver
      knows - are stored.</para>

      <para>After having generated the routes, we let the simulation run
      forcing it to generate edge- or lane-based dumps (see chapter 6, "<ulink
      url="#user_chp06-output-edgelanestates">Aggregated Edge/Lane
      States</ulink>"). In fact, edge-based dumps are the better choice,
      because the route is not able to use lane-based dumps at all. Now, we
      have the information about the state of the network, meaning the real
      speeds that were driven within it, when all vehicles are using the same
      route. Now we can pass this information to a second call to
      <application>DUAROUTER</application> and now - instead of the previous
      input file - we give the route alternatives file as input using the
      option <option>--alternatives</option> (or <option>-a</option> for
      short). Now, <application>DUAROUTER</application> is capable to compute
      the new shortest routes, based on the real speeds within our simulation.
      In order to avoid that again all vehicles will use the currently
      shortest route only some of the drivers will get the new shortest route.
      Again, two files are generated, a route file which contains the current
      routes and a new route alternatives file. The entries within the new
      alternatives file stay the same for all those drivers who keep their old
      route. Those who got a new route assigned, will get this route stored
      additionally to their previous route within the file. Whether a route is
      replaced by a new, better route is depending on how much better the new
      route is and how fast a driver shall forget his old one. There are two
      parameters determining this: <option>--gBeta</option> and
      <option>--gA</option>. Please see (see <ulink

        <title>Automatic Iteration using 'dua-iterate.pl'</title>

        <para>"dua-iterate.pl" helps you to perform the computation of a
        dynamic user assignment. The script needs at least two parameter: the
        path to the folder where you have located your SUMO-binaries in and
        the number of iteration steps to perform. When started with these to
        options, the script computes the given number of dua-steps. As input
        two files have to be located in the same folder as the script: a
        SUMO-network named "net.net.xml" and a set of trip definitions named
        "trips.trips.xml". if you want to start with another routes
        definition, you have to change this within the script's source
        code.</para>

        <para>Within each iteration step, the script generates a configuration
        file for the <application>DUAROUTER</application> and starts
        <application>DUAROUTER</application> with this configuration file.
        Then, a configuration file for <application>SUMO</application> is
        built and <application>SUMO</application> ist started. Both
        configuration files are competely defined within the script itself. As
        default, for each time step, <application>SUMO</application> will
        generate three dump files with edge-dumps aggregated over 150, 300,
        and 900s, an emissions and a trip information output. The names of
        these outputs are numbered over the iteration steps. If you want to
        change the outputs, you also have to take a look into the script, but
        you should not disable the edge-based dump for aggregation over 900s,
        because this is read by the <application>DUAROUTER</application> in
        the next iteration steps in order to compute the DUA.</para>

      <title>Additional Weights</title>

      <para>From version 0.8.0.1 on, SUMO is capable to load additional
      weights for edges. The idea behind this is to virtually increase the
      costs for an edge in order to make it less attractive to pass.
      Additional weights are used by the DUA-Router only and are supplied
      using the <option>--supplementary-weights
      <replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> (or <option>--add
      <replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> or <option>-S
      <replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option>) - option. A file
      containing additional weights looks like this:</para>

      <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;supplementary-weights&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;interval begin="60" end="119"&gt;</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag>&lt;weight edge-id="1fi" absolut="42" mult="2.5" add="-21"/&gt;</sgmltag>
      <sgmltag>&lt;weight edge-id="2o" mult="13"/&gt;</sgmltag>

      ... further weights ...

      </caution>

      <para>When additional weights are supplied, the DUA-Router first looks
      whether an additional, absolute value has been provide for the currently
      watched edge (value of the "<sgmltag>absolut</sgmltag>"-attribute for
      the current edge and time). If so, this value will be used. If not,
      either the edge's loaded weight (if available for the current time step)
      or the default value (length/vallowed) will be changed first by applying
      the loaded factor (value of the "<sgmltag>mult</sgmltag>"-attribute for
      the current edge and time) and than by the loaded addend (value of the
      "<sgmltag>add</sgmltag>"-attribute for the current edge and
      time).</para>

      <title>Closing Thoughts (so far)</title>

      <para>If you are want to simulate small scenarios only, with a few
      vehicles, you probably should try to work with routes where each vehicle
      is duplicated. This needs only a small amount of editing and lets you
      fill the simulation fast. This has been done for most of the examples
      within the example data. Trying to generate own OD-matrices is not to be
      adviced, because handling of such is not really well supported by the
      package. In fact, the OD2TRIPS tool definitely needs a complete
      redesign. Until this has happened, you should try to get your
      OD-matrices converted into flow-definitions if you really have to
      operate with OD-matrices. Using flows generated by hand may be a
      possibility, but for small scenarios, flows seem more clumsy than

      <para>Due to its scientific purpose, SUMO tasks lie beyond simple

      and one must be able to process them and furthermore possibilities to
      influence the simulation are necessary to make it more variable in use.

      the simulation and some further structures used are described in the

          <para>The id is any string that let's you know which detector is

          The attributes "<sgmltag>lane</sgmltag>" and

          aggregate the values they collect, the freq-attribute describes this
          period. The style-parameter is obsolete by now as the earlier
          possibility to use either "xml" or "cvs"-output is now not
          supported, the values are stored in xml-files only. The file

          <para>Most of the attributes have the same meaning as for induct
          loops. As an areal detector has a certain length, this length must
          be supplied as a further parameter. It may also be a negative number
          which lets the detector be extended upstream to the given beginning
          position. The type must be set to either "<sgmltag>areal</sgmltag>",
          "<sgmltag>lane_based</sgmltag>" or "<sgmltag>E2</sgmltag>" to let
          the simulation know what's desired to build. The optional parameter
          "cont" let's the detector continue over the current lane onto this
          lane's predecessors when the detector's length plus his position is
          larger than the place available on the lane. The attribute
          "<sgmltag>measures</sgmltag>" describes which values the detector
          shall compute. The optional values are described below.</para>

          <para>But there is also a further possibility to use E2-detectors.
          If you place them in front of a traffic light, you can use the
          traffic light to describe the intervals (aggregation) time instead
          of giving a fixed aggregation time. In this case, output will be
          generated every time the traffic light switches. To use this
          feature, simply replace the freq-attribute within the description of
          your detector by the id of the traffic light that should steer it
          (use the attribute "<sgmltag>tl</sgmltag>" to specify the id)

          <para>A further feature allows you to output values not for all
          switches of the traffic light the detector is attached to, but only
          when the light turns red for the assigned link (connection between
          the incoming and the outgoing lane). This should allow you to
          measure the maximum jam length in front of a red traffic light for
          this link. To switch on this feature, you have to add the name of
          the following lane:<sgmltag>
          to="<replaceable>&lt;LANE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"</sgmltag>. The
          incoming lane is already described by the
          "<sgmltag>lane</sgmltag>"-attribute.</para>

          <para>E2-detectors may compute many different measures and the user
          has the possibility to describe which measures he actually wants to
          be generated. The "measures"-attribute must contain the measures
          divided by a ' ' (blank) in the case he does not want to compute all
          parameters. Computing all parameters is the default case but may

        <para>In the hope that every user wants to know different things and
        is able to write a tool that parses this information from a not
        aggregated output, the network dump was the first output capability
        we've implemented. To force SUMO to build a file that contains the
        network dump, extend your command line (or configuration) parameter by
        <option>--netstate-dump</option> (or <option>--ndump</option> or
        <option>--netstate</option>)
        <option><replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option>.
        <option><replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> is hereby the
        name of the file the output will be written to. Any other file with
        this name will be overwritten, the destination folder must
        exist.</para>

        <para>The network dump is a xml-file containing for each time step
        every edge of the network with every lane of this edge with all
        vehicles on this lane. For each vehicle, his name, speed and position
        on his lane are written. A network dump-file looks like this:</para>

        <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;sumo-netstate&gt;</sgmltag>

      ... more edges ....

<sgmltag>   &lt;/timestep&gt;</sgmltag>

        <para>The values have the following meaning:</para>

        </itemizedlist>

        <para>As you may imagine, this output is very verbose. His main
        disadvantage is the size of the generated file. It's very easy to
        generate files that are several GB large within some minutes. It is of
        course possible to write some nice tools that parse the file (using a
        SAX-parser) and generate some meaningful information, but we do not
        know anyone who has made this. Another problem is that the
        simulation's execution speed of course breaks down when such an amount
        of data must be written.</para>

        <para>Normally, all lanes are written, even if there is no vehicle on
        them. You can change this behaviour using the boolean switch
        <option>--dump-empty-edges</option>. In this case, only those edges
        and lanes will be written that contain vehicles.</para>

        <para>TBD: --dump-end + dump-begin; difference lane-based &amp;
        edge-based</para>

        <para>This information is far more feasible than the network dump.
        There are two different types of these files, one is edge-based, the
        other lane-based. The aggregated state files contain information about
        all edges/lanes states of the network.</para>

        <para>To force SUMO to generate edge-based state dumps, you have to
        use two command line options: a) <option>--dump-basename
        <replaceable>&lt;PATH_AND_FILE_PREFIX&gt;</replaceable></option>
        describes where to write the dumps to and how the begin of the name
        is. b) <option>--dump-intervals
        <replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL&gt;</replaceable>[;<replaceable>&lt;INTERVAL&gt;</replaceable>]*</option>
        describes over what time the values shall be collected and aggregated
        ("interval length"). Each aggregation interval is written into an own,
        single file. The file name is made up from the base name and the
        aggregation interval: &lt;FILENAME&gt; =
        &lt;PATH_AND_FILE_PREFIX&gt;_&lt;INTERVAL&gt;.xml. An example:
        <option>--dump-basename=./output/lanedump
        --dump-intervals=300;600</option> will build two files:
        <filename>./output/lanedump_300.xml</filename> and
        <filename>./output/lanedump_600.xml</filename>. For edge-based state

      <sect2 id="user_chp06-trigger-public">
        <title>Public Transport</title>

        <para>Possibilities to simulate public transport were firstly added in
        version 0.9.3. By now you may define positions of bus stops and let
        vehicles ("busses") stop at these positions for a pre-given time.
        Definitions of bus stop locations in SUMO have the following format:
        <sgmltag>&lt;trigger
        id="<replaceable>&lt;BUS_STOP_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
        objecttype="bus_stop"

        [line="<replaceable>&lt;LINE_ID&gt;</replaceable>[;<replaceable>&lt;LINE_ID&gt;</replaceable>]*"]/&gt;</sgmltag>.
        That means that a bus stop is an area on a lane. The parameters have

        <para>Vehicles must be informed that they must stop at a bus stop. The

        <programlisting>    <sgmltag>&lt;vtype id="BUS" accel="2.6" decel="4.5" sigma="0.5" length="15" maxspeed="70"

    <sgmltag>&lt;/vehicle&gt;</sgmltag>
</programlisting>

        <para>What we have here is a vehicle named "0" being a "BUS". "BUS" is
        a referenced type declared earlier. The vehicle has an embedded route
        (written by hand in this case) and a list of stop places. Each stop
        place is described by two attributes, "<sgmltag>bus_stop</sgmltag>"
        and "<sgmltag>duration</sgmltag>" where "<sgmltag>bus_stop</sgmltag>"
        is the name of the bus stop the vehicle shall halt at and
        "<sgmltag>duration</sgmltag>" is the time the vehicle shall wait at
        the bus stop in seconds. Please remark that the order of bus stops the
        vehicle shall halt at must be correct.</para>

        <para>You may also let a vehicle stop at another position than a bus
        stop. The complete definition of a vehicle's stop is:
        <sgmltag>&lt;stop (
        bus_stop="<replaceable>&lt;BUS_STOP_ID&gt;</replaceable>" |
        lane="<replaceable>&lt;LANE_ID&gt;</replaceable>"
        pos="<replaceable>&lt;POSITION_AT_LANE&gt;</replaceable>" )
        duration="<replaceable>&lt;HALTING_DURATION&gt;</replaceable>"/&gt;</sgmltag>.
        This means you can <emphasis>either</emphasis> use a bus stop
        <emphasis>or</emphasis> a lane position to define where a vehicle has
        to stop.</para>

        <title>Variable Speed Signs (VSS)</title>

        <para>One of the trigger objects that may be specified within an
        additional file allows the simulation of variable speed signs. The
        syntax for such an object is: <sgmltag>&lt;trigger
        id="<replaceable>&lt;VSS_ID&gt;</replaceable>" objecttype="lane"
        objectid="<replaceable>&lt;LANE_ID&gt;</replaceable>" attr="speed"
        file="<replaceable>&lt;DEF_FILE&gt;</replaceable>"/&gt;</sgmltag>.
        This trigger is typed to be a vss by the combination of the values of
        the attributes <sgmltag>objecttype="lane"</sgmltag> and
        <sgmltag>attr="speed"</sgmltag>. Although no other combinations are
        implemented so far, this combination forces the simulation to change
        the attribute "speed" of a "lane"-object, exactly what vss do. Of
        course, the vehicles themselves do not override this maximum velocity
        what does not exactly represent the reality.</para>

        <para>You may have noticed that a file name must be supplied, called
        <sgmltag><replaceable>&lt;DEF_FILE&gt;</replaceable></sgmltag> within
        the schema above. This file must contain the information about when a
        certain speed shall be set onto the lane. This file has the following
        format:</para>

        <programlisting><sgmltag>&lt;vss&gt;</sgmltag>
   <sgmltag>&lt;step time="<replaceable>&lt;TIME&gt;</replaceable>" speed="<replaceable>&lt;SPEED&gt;</replaceable>"/&gt;</sgmltag>

   ... further entries ...

   <sgmltag>&lt;step time="<replaceable>&lt;TIME&gt;</replaceable>" speed="<replaceable>&lt;SPEED&gt;</replaceable>"/&gt;</sgmltag>
<sgmltag>&lt;/vss&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

        <para>Each <sgmltag>step</sgmltag> is a combination of the

    <title>Simulation-GUI</title>

    <para>The simulation-GUI (graphical user interface) is just a wrapper
    around the command line simulation. The normal procedure is to start the
    gui-version like any other Window-based application (double-click on it)
    and to load a simulation's description specified using a "normal"
    configuration-file as used by the simulation's command line version. After
    loading it - what may dure a longer time if the network is large or the
    simulation is forced to load many routes at once - the network shall
    appear. Your application should then look like displayed below (with your
    own network, of course).</para>

      controls as used below)</title>

    <para>You can now start your simulation using the "play"-button and/or
    manoeuvre within the network pressing one of the mouse buttons and moving
    the mouse. When moving the mouse within the window with the left button
    pressed, you'll move the network to the direction you move the mouse. When
    the mouse is moved with the right button pressed, you change the scale the
    network is displayed in, zooming into and out of the network.</para>

    <title>Tips, Tricks &amp; Tools</title>

    <para>We want to supply some additional information that did not fit into
    the descriptions within the previous chapters. The next chapters are
    possibly the most interesting ones of this document as they describe some
    possibilities to ease the work.</para>

    <para>We will now discuss the different possibilities to use the graphical
    user interface more deeply.</para>

    <sect1 id="user_chp08-configs">
      <title>Using Configuration Files</title>

      <para>Most simulations have to be executed more than only one time.
      Furthermore, some experiments require the execution of similar, slightly
      different settings, for example the same network with a different route
      set. To avoid the retyping of all the parameter at the input line, all
      of the main applications can be fed with a configuration file. This
      configuration file contains the values the user normally would give to
      the program at the command line. For example, instead of typing</para>

      <screen>duarouter --cell=<replaceable>myCellFile</replaceable> --net=<replaceable>mySUMONet.net.xml</replaceable> --output-file=<replaceable>MySUMORoutes.rou.xml</replaceable> \
   -b <replaceable>0</replaceable> -e <replaceable>3600</replaceable></screen>

      <para>you can start the router with a configuration file only:</para>

      <screen>duarouter -c=<replaceable>myConfig.rou.cfg</replaceable></screen>

      <para>The <option>-c <replaceable>&lt;FILE&gt;</replaceable></option> -
      option may be passed to all of the package's main applications.</para>

      <para>Of course, you have to build the configuration file
      "<filename>myConfig.rou.cfg</filename>" first. You can find templates
      for configuration files within the data/cfg_templates - folder and all
      examples coming with the release contain configuration files,
      too.</para>

      <para>A configuration file is a simple XML-file in which each of the
      command line parameter is represented as a XML-element with the
      parameter's value being given as text between the begin and end tag of
      this parameter. So if you want to set a parameter "foo" to the value
      "bar" within your configuration file, write
      <sgmltag>&lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;foo/&gt;</sgmltag> into the configuration
      file. Do not forget that each XML-file has to have a root element, so
      that the whole configuration file would look like this:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;configuration&gt;
   <sgmltag>&lt;foo&gt;</sgmltag>bar<sgmltag>&lt;foo/&gt;</sgmltag>
<sgmltag>&lt;/configuration&gt;</sgmltag></programlisting>

      <para>Between the starting at the ending tag, any type of values may be
      set, use a 'x' to mark boolean values as set. If a parameter allows a
      set of values (normally separated by a ';'), you have to use a single
      element and embed these value into it as you would on command line. A
      different approach will maybe be invented in future. You can find the
      templates for each of the package's application's configuration files
      within the folder
      "<filename>[SUMO]/data/cfg_templates</filename>".</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Using generated XML-Files</title>

      <para>All but imported files used by SUMO use XML as format. This makes
      their usage not as straightforward as plain CSV-file, for example, but
      with some additional tools, these files are far more flexible and
      powerful. Some tools can be found within the tools/-folder coming with
      the release.</para>

      <title>Additional Tools</title>

      <para>You can some find helpful tools within the
      <filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;</replaceable>/tools</filename>
      - folder. We will now introduce some of them. The following chapters are
      devided by the topic the tools cover.</para>

    <title>Naming Conventions</title>

    <para>To ease the usage of the supplied files, all of which are within a
    XML-derivate, we use a naming convention for the file extensions to allow
    a distinction between the contents with a single look. The list of used
    extensions is showed below. We of course highly encourage you to use this

        <para>You may have noticed, that different networks are supported with
        the same name begin. They differ in the number of lanes the edges have
        and whether a possibly existing junction is a simple right-of-way or a
        traffic light junction. The name pattern is as follows
        [SHAPE]<varname>X</varname>l for networks with right-of-way junctions,
        where <varname>X</varname> is the number of lanes and
        [SHAPE]<varname>X</varname>ltl for networks with a traffic light.
        [SHAPE] is the name of the coarse shape of the network.</para>
