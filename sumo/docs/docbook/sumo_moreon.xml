      <title>What is SUMO?</title>

      <para>SUMO is a traffic simulation tool. It was primarily designed for
      urban street networks, but it may also be used for highway traffic
      simulations. In the near future it will be extended to model other
      transit modes simultaneously with ordinary car traffic.</para>

      <title>About this document</title>

      <para>This document describes some certain parts SUMo covers in a larger
      detail than the developer documentation or the user documentation
      do.</para>

      <para>This document is still under development and is meant to grow with
      the software. Due to this, you may find it together with the sources
      within out repository at sourceforge (<ulink
      url="http://sumo.sourceforge.net">http://sumo.sourceforge.net/</ulink>).
      It should always describe the current version.</para>

      <para>Please let us know when either the document remains at any point
      unclear or any of the applications does not behave as expected. We also
      seek for some participants and further users, not only to share the
      development tasks, but also to gain some feedback and critics or some
      usage examples.</para>

    <title>More on... Traffic Lights</title>

    <para>Within this first chapter, we will describe how traffic lights are
    implemented and used within SUMO. As basically, traffic lights affect the
    right-of-way rules at a junction, we will first describe how right-of-way
    rules are implemented within SUMO. Afterwards, the additional concept of
    traffic lights is given.</para>

        <title>Links: A Connection between Lanes</title>

        <para>Each lane (<classname>MSLane</classname>) beside dead ends has a
        list of at least one following lane. A link (MSLink) connects this
        following and the lane we regard. Basically, we consider two types of
        connections between lanes. In the first case, vehicles are able to
        pass the connection every time, without regarding other, possibly
        crossing traffic. Such connections may be found at highways or if the
        connection is a primary road and it is assured that the vehicle is
        able to pass this link without a collision. Such connections are
        called "<emphasis>priorised</emphasis>" connections. The other
        connections are called "<emphasis>unpriorised</emphasis>". They are
        found on minor roads and a vehicle passing them must decelerate in
        front of them, because it may have to stop to let other vehicles pass
        the junction first. Please regard, that a junction may consist of
        several connections (links) of different type.</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Usage of Links within the Simulation</title>

        <para>If a vehicle approaches a link (<classname>MSLink</classname>),
        it lets the link know about it by calling <function>void
        <classname>MSLink</classname>::setApproaching(<classname>MSVehicle</classname>
        *approaching)</function>. This is done in <function>void
        <classname>MSVehicle</classname>::vsafeCriticalCont( SUMOReal
        boundVSafe )</function> as soon as a vehicle will have to decelerate
        to manage to stop in front of the link. Even if the vehicle is too
        near or too fast to decelerate in front of the link, the link will
        still be informed until the vehicle will finally pass it. By doing
        this, each link knows whether a vehicle is approaching or not and
        stores this vehicle in <varname>MSLink::myApproaching</varname>. In
        addition, the information about approaching a link is stored by the
        link into the <classname>MSLogicJunction::Request
        </classname>structure of the junction
        (<classname>MSRightOfWayJunction</classname>) it belongs to. After all
        vehicles have stored this information,
        <classname>MSRightOfWayJunction</classname> is able to compute which
        of the approaching vehicles will have to wait and which not using its
        <classname>MSJunctionLogic</classname>.</para>

        <para>If you are confused about all these classes, the next diagram
        which shows how the hierarchy of SUMO junction classes, may help
        you.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Remark that some of the classes are interfaces with only one
          implementation. It is possible, that this tree is a matter to change
          in the next time.</para>

        <para>In the next pass (but within the same simulation step), each of
        the vehicles is touched again, but by now it is known whether the
        vehicle is allowed to pass the junction using his link or not. If not,
        the vehicle will decelerate and stop in front of the link (or a
        vehicle in front of it, that is also waiting). If the link is
        "unpriorised", the vehicle will decelerate in front of it, even if it
        may pass it. If the link is "priorised" and the vehicle may pass, the
        vehicle will continue his drive without being hindered.</para>

        <title>Setting Information by MSLogicJunctions</title>

        <para>As we have seen, a MSLogicJunction gives way to the vehicles
        after the knowledge about all incoming vehicles has been set. We have
        seen that this information was stored in a structure named
        "<classname>MSLogicJunction::Reques</classname>t". This is simply a
        list of bits, a <classname>std::bitset&lt;64&gt;</classname>, where
        each bit represents the information whether a certain link is
        approached by a vehicle currently (it's then set to true otherwise
        it's false).</para>

        <para>What traffic lights do is simply to mask off those requests
        which are approaching a currently red sign. By doing this, the
        response for these streams is also set to false which forces the
        approaching vehicles to stop in front of the junction. Furthermore,
        this method keeps the row-logic of the junction untouched, what allows
        to use it for letting vehicles moving left - in the part of the world
        that drives on the right sied, that means those streams which have to
        cross an enemy stream - wait until there is a gap in the enemy stream
        they can use to move over the junction.</para>

        <title>Switching the Phases</title>

        <para>What we furthermore need to know is how a traffic light is
        forces to switch its phases and how the links get informed about this.
        When being instantiated, the tls adds an event to SUMO's event handler
        (<classname>MSEventHandler</classname>). This is done within the
        <classname>MSTrafficLightLogic</classname>-constructor, a class from
        which all tls algorithms are derived (see above). This event, being a
        <classname>MSTrafficLightLogic::SwitchCommand</classname> executes the
        following steps:</para>

        <programlisting>SUMOTime execute() {
   size_t step1 = myTLLogic-&gt;getStepNo(); // get the current phase index
   SUMOTime next = myTLLogic-&gt;trySwitch(); // try to switch, get next duration
   size_t step2 = myTLLogic-&gt;getStepNo(); // get the phase index after possible switch
   if(step1!=step2) { // has the phase changed?
      myTLLogic-&gt;onSwitch(); // yes -&gt; do some further actions (see below)
      myTLLogic-&gt;setLinkPriorities(); // inform the links about current state
   }
   return next; // return period after which the tls shall be tried to switch again
}
</programlisting>

        <para>Let's review it. At first, we remember the state of the tls
        before trying to switch it in the variable <varname>step1</varname>.
        This "state" is simply the index of the current tls phase. Then, we
        try to switch the tls using <function>trySwitch()</function> and gain
        the period to the next try which we save in <varname>next</varname>.
        After this, we check whether the tls has really changed by asking for
        its current step. If the step before and the step after trying to
        switch the tls are not the same, the tls has switched. We then inform
        the links about it using the
        <classname>MSTrafficLightLogic::setLinkPriorities</classname>
        function. The call to <function>onSwitch</function> should not bother
        you, herein. It is not a part of the tls-steering, but used to inform
        connected structures about the phase change. By now, only assigned
        detectors (see [!!!]) may be informed and their assignment is done
        separately from the tls-implementations. The comparison between the
        step before and after trying to switch is needed, as maybe the tls
        decides not to switch, yet, although the phases duration is over (see
        the <ulink url="#more_tls-existing-static">description of the
        agentbased tls</ulink>). After all has been done, we return the period
        to wait until we again try to switch the tls. If you want, your
        implementation of "<function>trySwitch</function>" may always return 1
        in order to check the tls each simulation step.</para>

        <title>The whole procedure</title>

        <para>So the whole procedure of bringing a vehicle save over a
        junctions is as following:</para>

        <procedure>
          <step>
            <para><function>MSNet::myJunctions-&gt;resetRequests();</function></para>

            <para>This resets all junctions' requests to false, that means,
            that no vehicles from previous steps may inference with the
            current network state</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>... (several other things may happen, here)</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para><function>MSNet::myEdges-&gt;moveCritical();</function></para>

            <para>Herein, vehicles which approach a junction set their
            request</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para><function>MSNet::myLogics-&gt;maskRedLinks();</function></para>

            <para>Requests for vehicles which have red are reset to
            false</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para><function>MSNet::myJunctions-&gt;setAllowed();</function></para>

            <para>The junctions compute which vehicles may pass them and which
            have to wait</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para><function>MSNet::myLogics-&gt;maskYellowLinks();</function></para>

            <para>Reallow vehicles trying to pass a yellow tls to pass the
            junction</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para><function>MSNet::myEdges-&gt;moveFirst();</function></para>

            <para>Move all those vehicles (not only the first one, but all
            first ones) that approach a junction</para>
          </step>
        </procedure>

        <para>What is the meaning of the sixth step? Imagine what shall happen
        with vehicles driving over yellow. They should stop, but if they are
        too near to the junction, one has to let them through. Also, they have
        to be taken into account if an enemy stream exists. In this case, they
        maybe have to make vehicles on this stream wait. To achieve this, at
        first only red links are set to false. This is given as input to the
        junction's row-logics and that lets all vehicles having red wait,
        vehicles which have yellow may be able to pass the junction. Then,
        vehicles having yellow are set to false which lets them try to stop in
        front of the tls.</para>

          <para>You probably have seen, that the
          <sgmltag>inclanes-tag</sgmltag> is buggy. In fact, the links
          (connections between two consecutive lanes, see above) are added
          almost at the end of the loading process. When a link is built, the
          tls-logic which controls it is informed about it getting the
          information which stream information is used by the link. This
          information is given as an index to the fields
          <sgmltag>phase</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>brake</sgmltag> and
          <sgmltag>yellow</sgmltag> from the <sgmltag>phase</sgmltag>-element
          of the tls-description described above.</para>

          <para>The information about a link is represented as following

          <para>Let's consider the element "succlane" only, the element "succ"

        <title>Static TLS (MSSimpleTrafficLightLogic)</title>

        <para>This tls-type simply obtains the list of phases from the
        description and switches between the cycles after each cycle's period
        is over. We have seen that the tls algorithm is stored in
        <function>trySwitch()</function>. What a simple traffic light's
        implementation does is the following:</para>

        <programlisting>SUMOTime
MSSimpleTrafficLightLogic::trySwitch()
{
    // increment the index
    myStep++;
    // if the last phase was reached ...
    if(myStep==myPhases.size()) {
        // ... set the index to the first phase
        myStep = 0;
    }
    // return offset to the next switch
    assert(myPhases.size()&gt;myStep);
    return myPhases[myStep]-&gt;duration;
}
</programlisting>

        <para>That means that we simply rotate our index over the phases and
        return each phase's duration as the time that has to pass before the
        traffic light is switched one step further.</para>

        <para>Ok, this is not really that hard. A bus stop is simply a part of
        a lane, so we need the lane, the begin and the end position.
        Additionally we want to know which lines will hold there. Knowing
        this, we have to generate a MSBusStop.h and its implementation
        MSBusStop.cpp:</para>

        <para>Take a look at MSTrigger *NLTriggerBuilder::buildTrigger(MSNet

        &amp;base,const NLHandler &amp;helper). Think about a name for your
        trigger and add the call to a function which parses your structure.
        For our purpose, we will add the following lines to this
        function:</para>

        <programlisting>    } else if(type=="bus_stop") {
        t = parseAndBuildBusStop(net, attrs, base, helper);

</programlisting>

        <para>Then you of course have to implement the function that builds
        the structure itself. . To implement the function we add its

        part:</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Prerequisites</title>

        <para>The next picture shows the network we have used within the
        project "INVENT". It was given to us as an VISUM network. As
        VISUM-routes normally start at explicite feeding edges, we could
        reduce the network by removing geometry nodes. The routes were given
        as OD-matrices in a ptv-Format. They define the flows for the time
        betwee 5am and 12pm (!!!). After converting the matrices using
        <application>OD2TRIPS</application> into trips we were able to begin
        with the DUA. The assignment was made using the
        <filename>iterate.pl</filename> - script described here (tbd).</para>

        <title>Evaluations of the DUA</title>

        <para>The DUA has been run 40 times in order to check the behaviour of
        the algorithm. As output, we generated the vehicle emissions (see
        chapter tbd), vehicle trip duration (see chapter tbd) and edge-based
        dumps (see chapter TBD), the latest with aggregation times of 150s,
        300s and 900s.</para>

        <para>We will now examine the data generated, starting with the
        vehicle emissions file.</para>

          <title>Development of Vehicle Emissions</title>

          <para>The vehicle emissions file (see chapter tbd) gives information
          about how many vehicles were loaded/runnning and have started/ended
          for each time stemp. Additionally, the time the simulation needed to
          compute the step is written.</para>

            <title>Running Vehicles</title>

            <para>The next picture shows the development of the number of
            vehicles within the simulation over the dua iteration process.
            Every 5th iteration is shown. The plot was done using the
            following gnuplot command after converting the xml-output into
            files readable by gnuplot:</para>

            <para>Lets review what we see:</para>

            <orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>The number of running vehicles decreases with each
                step</para>

                <para>What we see here in fact is exactly the reason for using
                a dynamic user assignment. The large number of vehicles within
                the first iterations indicates that new vehicles are inserted
                into the network while the previously inserted have not yet
                left. The reason why previously inserted vehicles are still in
                the net is that they got stocked in jams. And the jams occured
                because all vehicles are trying to use the same route.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Not every following iteration step is better than the
                previous</para>

                <para>It may be supposes that this may only be due to the
                dynamic changes within the simulation. That means, that both
                small changes within the routes' distribution and the
                stochasticity in the microscopic model may yield in a larger
                jam which breaks down the network's capacity. Nevertheless, it
                is also possible that the microscopic model is not flexible
                enough not to cause the network to be free of jams and
                grid-locks as the reality is.</para>
              </listitem>
            </orderedlist>

            <para>Now let's recheck the last steps (step 30-39) using:</para>

            <screen>gnuplot&gt; set xlabel "t"

            <para>If we remove those "broken" assignments, we can see that the
            development is almost closed at step 30 and only a small advantage
            can is done:</para>

            <screen>gnuplot&gt; set xlabel "t"

            <para>It is not clear whether it is necessary to try the really
            optimal approach. One can assume that in reality, some drivers are
            still passing major roads they know without asking about a shorter
            possibility. As the next picture shows, the dua of step !!! is
            fitting very well to the data we got from detectors within
            Magdeburg.</para>

            <para>One can state, that the dua is finished if the vehicles
            running in a simulation step is not changing over some iteration
            step dramatically. A real function or algorithm for evaluating
            this but is still missing.</para>

            <para>Almost the same information can be gained using the
            information about the number of vehicles that have left the
            simulation stored within the emissions file. As one may see within
            the next picture, the number of vehicles which have left the
            simulation is increasing with the iteration step. This of course
            has the same reasons as described within the previous chapter: the
            vehicles get stocked in the simulation due to jams.</para>

            <para>That vehicles are stocked may be also visualised using the
            number of waiting vehicles. Vehicles are declared as waiting if
            they can not be emitted into the network, because their departure
            edge is full. The next picture shows the development of this value

  <chapter id="more_tests">
    <title>More on... Software Tests</title>

    <para>Since version 0.9.3 we support smoe basic tests which prove the
    software functionality. The number of the available tests is not that
    large, yet, but it will hopefuly grow with time. Ths chapter describes how
    to set up the testing system and how to use it.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Audience:</emphasis> developers</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Acceptance Testing using TextTest</title>

      <sect2>
        <title>About</title>

        <para>We use "<ulink
        url="http://texttest.carmen.se/">TextTest</ulink>" to test whether the
        sosftware still behaves as expected. What this application does is
        simply to compare an application's output (both normal and errors) and
        optionally also the output generated by the application with
        predefined outputs from files.</para>

        <para>There are some advantages and disadvantages of this approach. On
        the one hand, you can guarantee that the application is doing what is
        wanted by comparing all outputs with files you think are right. But
        this is also the problem with this approach: you do not have the
        assurance that the files you are comparing the current outputs to ARE
        right - you have to check these by hand.</para>

        <para>Anyhow, I think that for the current progress stage, this
        approach should be used, because a) the tests are quite small and
        errors can be easily seen b) it is working.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Install</title>

        <para>At first, you have to download and install "<ulink
        url="http://texttest.carmen.se/">TextTest</ulink>" from <ulink
        url="http://texttest.carmen.se/">http://texttest.carmen.se/</ulink>.
        The installation seems to be not that easy at first, but if you just
        follow the steps described in TestText's documentation, you'll have
        the system up and running in some minutes. Before continuing, please
        check whether the tests included with the TextTest distribution run
        before proceeding.</para>

        <para>After installing TextTest, you have to set an environment
        variables in order to make the system run:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><envar>TEXTTEST_HOME</envar></para>

            <para>Set it to the path SUMO-tests are located in
            (<filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO_DIST&gt;</replaceable>/tests</filename>
            for the tests that come with the distribution)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>This environment variable forces TextTest to use the specified
        directory as source of tests.</para>

        <para>But, yep, this should be all on installing the tests-subsystem
        so far.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Running the Tests</title>

        <para>Within the
        <filename><replaceable>&lt;SUMO&gt;</replaceable>/tests</filename> -
        folder you can find batch-files which start TextTest.
        "runAllTests.bat" starts TextTest for testing all apllications located
        in the folder, "<filename>runNetconvertTests.bat</filename>" will only
        show tests for
        <application><application>NETCONVERT</application></application>,
        "<filename>runDuarouterTests.bat</filename>" only those for
        <application><application>DUAROUTER</application></application>
        etc.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Setting up new Tests</title>

        <para>Please follow the instructions for TextTest. The system is
        configured in a way that output networks should have the name
        "net.net.xml" and should be wirtten to the current folder. If you add
        your tests this way, the messages the system prints (both normal and
        errors) and the generated files should be compared with the expected
        files.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Coverage and Results</title>

        <para>As said before, further tests have to be added. The following
        tests are currently available:</para>
