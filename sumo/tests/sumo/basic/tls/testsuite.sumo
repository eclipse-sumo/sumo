# The following subfolders test whether setting a different simulation begin affects the program
#  Of course, this should not be the case, the program should be same (in case of static tls),
#  independent of the time the simulation starts at
#
# We do not need vehicle movement as we only watch the tls switch

# Simulation starts at 0
begin0

# Simulation starts at 50
begin50

# Simulation starts at 100
begin100
