# bug [ 1993928 ] --keep-edges.input-file does not remove empty
#  When importing a large network and trying to reduce it by giving a list of
#  edges to keep, the resulting network only contains the given edges. Ok, but
#  ALL nodes are included, not only those used by the edges. Loading the
#  network into guisim shows nothing...
