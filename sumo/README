What is SUMO?
=============

"Simulation of Urban MObility" (SUMO) is an open source, highly portable, microscopic
road traffic simulation package designed to handle large road networks. The project
homepage can be found at

        http://sumo.dlr.de/

It is mainly developed by employees of the Institute of Transportation Systems
at the German Aerospace Center (http://www.dlr.de/ts).



Where to get it?
================

You can download SUMO from SourceForge via our downloads site:

        http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Downloads


As the program is still under development and is extended continuously, we advice you to
use the latest sources from our Subversion repository. Using a command line svn client
the following command should work:

        svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/sumo/code/trunk/sumo

To stay informed, we have a mailing list for SUMO. To subscribe, send mail to
sumo-user-request@lists.sourceforge.net with the word subscribe in the message body.
Messages to the list can be sent to sumo-user@lists.sourceforge.net.
SUMO announcements will be made through the sumo-announce@lists.sourceforge.net list;
you can subscribe to this list by sending a message "subscribe" to the list server at

Build and Installation.
=======================

For Windows we provide pre-compiled binaries and Visual Studio project files.
Using Linux a simple "./configure && make" should be enough for the distributions, if you
have installed all needed libraries properly. Using the repository checkout you
need to issue "make -f Makefile.cvs" before "./configure && make" in order to run
the autoconf utilities creating configure and the Makefiles.
If configure does not find the libraries or includes needed, please check
"./configure --help" for information on how to specify the paths needed.

For detailed build instructions have a look at our wiki:

Getting started.
================

To get started with SUMO, take a look at the examples directory, which contains
some example networks with routing data and configuration files.
There is also user documentation provided in the docs/ directory and on the
homepage.



Bugs.
=====

Please use for bugs and requests our bug tracking tool which provides OpenID access

        http://sumo.dlr.de/trac/

or file them to the list sumo-users@lists.sourceforge.net. Before
filing a bug, please consider to check with a current subversion checkout
that the problem still persists.
